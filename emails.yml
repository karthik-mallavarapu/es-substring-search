    I am recommending Linda Robertson (currently Assistant Secretary for the \nDepartment

    Government Affairs.  Linda would head our Washington, D.C. \noffice, replacing
    Joe Hillings who will be retiring early next year.\n\n Linda has interviewed with
    Ken Lay, Tom White, Mike McConnell and Jeff \nShankman, who join me in this recommendation.\n\n
    Attached are biographical information on Linda and a National Journal \narticle
    identifying Linda among the \"Washington 100\".\n\n We have conducted extensive
    reference checks on Linda.  Included among those \nwas Secretary Summers who said:\n\n\"Nobody
    I know has the determination she has to get objectives met.\"\n\"Far more capacity

    Harry,

    Thanks for your reply to my 20 trip rules

    Yes, Brenda and I are already planning our next group trip ( however, we have
    only been able to obtain 7 confirmations but not to worry, Macey is included
    and I will make videos for you if we are unable to confirm space for you too.)

    As to "no other fool would walk with you in the morning," have you considered
    a deaf person might enjoy walks with you.

    And, Brenda and I go as a "package" so when you think of Brenda you cannot
    help but include me....sorry.

    Finally, as to the spelling your name in the letter, my secretary made the
    mistake when she retyped what Brenda and I wrote and faxed and E-mailed it to
    all.  We would never miss the spelling of your name because we have always
    thought it was a dichotomy that your last name included "reason."

    Have a good trip.    John

    PAGER: 888-781-2151 \nNew Radio Ad Slams Corzine Dishonesty \nSurrounding Questionable
    Financial Dealings\n\nWashington, DC -- Calling the campaign of liberal New Jersey
    Democrat Senate \ncandidate Jon Corzine, \"a cynical and manipulative effort to
    deceive New \nJersey voters about Corzine's questionable and mysterious financial
    \ndealings,\" Mark Miller, Executive Director of the Republican Leadership \nCouncil
    (RLC) announced the release of a new radio ad that begins airing this \nmorning
    throughout New Jersey. \n\nThe text of the 60-second radio ad, entitled \"Dodge,\"
    is as follows: \n\nAnnouncer: \n\nMoney can buy multi-millionaire Jon Corzine
    a lot, but it can't buy New \nJersey's trust... he must earn it.? And that's a
    problem for Jon Corzine. \n? \nAccording to recent news reports, Jon Corzine is
    having trouble with the \ntruth. \n\nCorzine and his supporters were asked if
    Jon Corzine had contributed to their \norganizations prior to receiving their
    political endorsements.? The answer \nwas \"no\". \n\nNow, Corzine's own records
    indicate his foundation did give one of the groups \na contribution.? Corzine
    responded that the contribution came before he \nannounced his candidacy.? But
    Corzine's own records revealed that he made the \ncontribution after he announced
    his candidacy.? Corzine said the tax exempt \ncontribution was for an after school
    program.? But the group's leader said \nthat Corzine knew the contribution was
    for a political office. \n\nCall Jon Corzine at 973/643-0500.? Tell him trust
    is something money can't \nbuy.? Paid for by the Republican Leadership Council.
    \n\n?Said Miller: \"Jon Corzine has created his own campaign problems by \ncontinuing
    to shroud his financial past in secrecy.? Mr. Corzine's vast \nwealth has allowed
    him to buy a record number of slick political ads, but if \nhe thinks he can simply
    purchase the trust of New Jerseyans, he's in for a \nvery unpleasant surprise.\"

    for your note about our new television ad.  Our goal with the ad \ncampaign is
    to increase Enron's familiarity and favorability with business \nand government
    opinion leaders.  We want to do that by communicating the \ninnovative culture
    at Enron that always asks the question, \"Why?\"  When we \nheard businesses blaming
    poor financial performance on their inability to \nmanage weather risks, we asked,
    \"Why?\"  We answered that with our weather \nderivatives product that helps companies
    protect revenues from unfavorable \nweather.  Now, many equity analysts and other
    investors are challenging \ncompanies that don't use weather derivatives as a
    risk management tool.\n\nIn order to get our message across in a cluttered advertising
    environment, we \nneed to create compelling images to get that message accross.
    \ The use of a \ntraditional symbol (the old cork gun shooting gallery) applied
    in a \nnon-traditional way (shooting down conventional wisdom) gets the point
    across \nvery directly that traditional excuses don't \"stand up\" to today's
    markets.  \nI think it's a powerful, and humorous, symbolic message.\n\nI'm sorry

    Mr. Lay--

    I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports
    Facilities, L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million
    prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by
    the partners to the referendum campaign.

    Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority, we expect
    to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this
    week.  The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the
    partnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from
    each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed
    to the campaign instead of being distributed.  I have discussed this
    procedure with Sue Walden.

    With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and
    Shell had agreed to.  The monies being contributed to the referendum

    Ken,

    ?

    I have been watching a new company since April. The founder worked at=20
    Insource Technology as a consultant for a while and is a good guy. The=20
    service is explained in the executive summary attached, but in a nutshell=
    =20
    they solve the need for reliable information support for schools by getting=
    =20
    the server out of the schools and onto an Application Service Provider. The=
    =20
    result is much better information (attendance, grading, assignments,=20
    messages, etc.) but the schools only need a simple computer with a browser =
    to=20
    access the service. If one computer breaks, they simply move to another=20
    computer and access the service. This is the same concept as Questia, but=
    =20
    they can get by with much older computer technology, which is a big plus fo=
    r=20
    schools. Also, parents can access essentially real time information about=
    =20
    their child=01,s grades and attendance, and can easily communicate with the=
    =20
    teacher through the messaging.

    ?

    When I met with them in April, I liked the idea but was consumed with=20
    Questia. Since then, they have launched a beta test and then rolled out the=
    =20
    production version of the service in the DeSoto ISD. They trained over 200=
    =20
    teachers and have proven the simplicity and effectiveness of their system.=
    =20
    Lamar Consolidated ISD has requested that they rollout the service in three=
    =20
    test schools this fall.? They also just hired a new CEO, Roland Rodriquez, =
    to=20
    lead the company, with the founder continuing to be involved.

    ?

    They are trying to raise $3 million. John Chaney and I met with them Tuesda=
    y=20
    morning and decided after the meeting that we were both interested in putti=
    ng=20
    around half a million in the company, and that we needed to get three or fo=
    ur=20
    others to put in about the same amount.? We are both willing to go on the=
    =20
    board, with one or two other new outside directors.

    ?

    Ken, this is not in the same ballpark as Questia, but it is a very good ide=
    a=20
    and I believe they can pull it off. Please let me know if you have any=20
    questions and if you would like to have a meeting with them.

  subject: Talking Points re "reregulation" in California
  text: "As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are
    some \ntalking points for your use.\n\nOverall message:  the market is working,
    regulation is not.\n\nIn California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years
    while new \ncapacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded
    by \nproposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak
    \ndemand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, \nhas
    failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not \nderegulation.\n\nWhen
    San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, \nEnron responded
    with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego \ncustomers from price
    volatility and provided prices below their current \nsummer levels (Enron's price
    was about $55/MWH).  After publication of \nEnron's offer, nine other companies
    made offers.  Again, the market responded \nwhere regulation failed.  San Diego
    has not accepted any of these offers \nbecause of regulatory/legislative restrictions
    on its ability to buy outside \nof the PX (i.e. the spot market).\n\nIn markets
    where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional \ngeneration.
    \ Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.  \nThose plants were
    planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time \nfor the summer of
    1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market \nresponds.\n\nThe solution
    to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition \nnot reregulation.
    \ Policy makers should:\n\nOpen the transmission grid so that power can get from
    where it is to where it \nis needed.\n\nExpedite interconnection of new generation.\n\nExpedite
    siting of new facilities.\n\nGive customers a choice, so that they have better
    access to demand side \nsolutions.\n\n\nAlso attached is a more detailed discussion
    of California, prepared by Jeff \nDasovich of our San Francisco office.\n"

         RPI TO INITIATE PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS ON ANTI-HEPATITIS C DRUG

    BOULDER,  Colorado  -  September  28,  2000: Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
    (RPI)  (NASDAQ:RZYM)  today announced that it has repurchased its rights to
    Heptazyme?  from  Eli Lilly and Company and will initiate Phase II clinical
    trials  as  soon  as  possible  for  the Anti-Hepatitis C ribozyme to study
    dose-ranging  and  biological  markers  of  the  drug's efficacy in chronic
    Hepatitis C patients.

    Earlier  this month, RPI and Eli Lilly and Company completed a 28 day study
    of Heptazyme (LY466700) following daily subcutaneous injections that showed
    successful  safety,  tolerability  and pharmacokinetics.  The next phase of
    clinical trials will examine the safety and efficacy of Heptazyme alone, at
    higher  doses  than  used  in  previous  studies,  and  in combination with
    interferon,  a  current  treatment  for  patients  with  Hepatitis C  virus
    infection.

    Lilly has directed the clinical trials for the Anti-Hepatitis C ribozyme to
    date   under   a   licensing   agreement  between  the  parties.   Ribozyme
    Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.  has now renegotiated the global rights to Heptazyme
    and  will  direct  all  subsequent  clinical trials.  The Phase II trial is
    expected to begin in the first quarter of 2001.

    "We  are  pleased  to  be  able  to repurchase Heptazyme rights and to have
    resources  to  develop  it aggressively," said Ralph E. Christoffersen, CEO
    and  President  of RPI.  "We are committed to address the need for improved
    therapies  for  HCV,  and  plan  to  move forward as quickly as feasible in
    Heptazyme's development."

    Ribozymes   are  the  product  of  Nobel  Prize  winning  science  and  are
    synthetically engineered to act as "molecular scissors" capable of cleaving
    target RNA in a highly specific manner.

    RPI (www.rpi.com), located in Boulder, Colorado, is the acknowledged leader
    in ribozyme therapeutic development.  RPI has recently announced a ribozyme
    commercial  development  program  to develop a ribozyme therapeutic against
    Hepatitis  B.  RPI is partnered with Chiron Corporation for the development

  subject: Regenesys
  text: "Ken and Mark,\n\nRichard Lewis mentioned to me that you had recently read
    an article about \nRegenesys, the large-scale battery technology being developed
    in the UK, and \nwanted to know more about Enron's potential interest in this
    technology.  I \nam a Manager in our UK Origination and have tracked the progress
    of Regenesys \nsince it first came on the scene over one year ago.  We have watched
    it with \ninterest given the historical peak/off-peak spread in this country's
    power \nmarket.  Bruce Stram and I have also co-ordinated our efforts on the \npreliminary
    analysis.\n\nBelow is a brief summary of Regenesys, our initial views on the technology
    \nand our response going forward.\n\nTechnology Summary\nlarge-scale battery system
    using two oppositely-charged electrolytes that are \nseparated by an ion exchange
    membrane\ncurrent generating plant capacity up to 14.75 MW per unit (or 120 MWh
    per day)\nresponse time within 20 milliseconds\nit can release full power within
    a few seconds thereby yielding brief \ncapacity of up to 500 MW\n$1500 / kW capital
    costs initially which are expected to decrease to approx. \n$750 / kW \n18 month
    build time for facility which requires a site of just under 1 \nhectare (50 m
    x 60 m)\n\n\nLatest Developments\nInnogy announced last month that it will proceed
    with it's first Regenesys \nplant at Aberthaw Power Station in the UK\nTennessee
    Valley Authority has just signed some form of agreement with Innogy \non the Regenesys
    technology but there are no firm decisions to build a unit \nthere yet\n\nOur
    Cynical Point of View\nInnogy have got to go a long way before they can make this
    technology \ncommercially successful\nOur initial analysis shows that based on
    the peak/off-peak spreads they need \nto achieve capital costs less than $600
    / kW to be successful - we have not \nseen evidence that this can be achieved\nInnogy
    have been hyping up the technology in the past month to support the \nforthcoming
    spilt of National Power and to prepare for a potential floatation\nThere has been
    a flurry of press releases and news articles recently yet the \nspecifications
    of the technology (including capital cost) have not improved \nsince we first
    looked at this in July 1999\nInnogy touts this as a revolution in energy storage
    for peak/off-peak \narbitrage, however, commercially it does not compare to having
    large-scale \ndiesel standby generation\n\nOn the Brighter Side\nThe real potential
    for this technology could be in supporting grid systems \nIt has good black start
    and frequency response capabilities\n\nWay Forward\nWe are evaluating the commercial
    attraction of the black start and frequency \nresponse characteristics with respect
    to our interests in the UK\nI will continue to liaise with Bruce Stram in evaluating
    any further \npotential in the US\n\nPlease let me know if you would like any
    further details on the above.\n\nRegards,\n\nChris"

    Ric--

    I am writing to confirm our discussion of yesterday afternoon.  After we
    spoke, I conferred with John Watson who, like me, believed that we were
    going to use terms of the Enron Field financing for the Arena, with a few
    minor changes that we had discussed.  The term sheet that we originally
    provided you during the summer reflected that arrangement.  We have
    discussed that term sheet with the partners, believing it to be the deal,
    and they have approved the garage loan on those terms.

    John and I believe that the comments on the term sheet that you, James
    Hernandez and Mike Bartolotta have provided us recently constitute a
    significant departure from the Enron Field deal.  Although we understand the
    arguments each of you have made in favor of such comments, these comments
    nonetheless will need to be evaluated by a business representative from the
    partnership and approved by the partnership.  I recommend that we schedule a
    meeting next week so that we can discuss these issues and try to resolve
    them.

    Finally, John was disappointed to hear that the HCHSA will be unwilling to
    prepay the $1.4 million amount needed by the referendum.  Because we
    understand that the referendum campaign is in dire need of funding, we hope
    that you might reconsider your decision not to prepay the $1.4 million until
    after we have finalized the term sheet.

    I will be unavailable for a great deal of the day today, but I will have
    time to meet next week.  Please let me know when we might be able to get
    together to discuss the term sheet.

    Sincerely,

    Michael S. Telle

    PASS THIS ON TILL IT REACHES EVERYONE BY ELECTION TIME

    Our Senators and Congressmen don't pay in to Social Security, and, of
    course, they don't collect from it.The reason is that they have a
    special retirement plan that they voted for themselves many years ago.
    For all practical purposes, it works like this:

    When they retire, they continue to draw their same pay, until they die,
    except that it may be increased from time to time, by cost of living
    adjustments. For instance, former Senator Bradley, and his wife, may be
    expected to draw $7,900,000, with Mrs.. Bradley drawing $275,000 during
    the last year of her life. This is calculated on an average life span
    for each. This would be well and good, except that they paid nothing in
    on any kind of retirement, and neither does any other Senator or
    Congressman.

    This fine
    retirement comes right out of the General Fund: our tax money. While we
    who pay for it all, draw an average of $1000/month from Social Security.
    Imagine for a moment that you could structure a retirement plan so
    desirable that people would have extra deducted so that they could
    increase their own personal retirement income. A retirement plan that
    works so well, that  Railroad employees, Postal Workers, and others who
    aren't in it, would clamor to get in. That is how good Social Security
    could be, if only one small change were made. That change is to jerk the
    Golden Fleece retirement out from under the Senators and Congressmen,
    and put them in Social Security with the rest of us. Then watch how fast
    they fix it. If enough people receive this, maybe one or some of them
    along the way,  might be able to help.

  text: |-
    Mr. Lay--

    During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would
    contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts
    suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation
    against other contributions that they solicited.

    After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that
    you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting
    contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

    Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the
    Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they
    have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike
    suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that
    would be solicited by the Rockets.

    Would you please let me know if this is acceptable to you.  You or Rosalee
    may call me at 713-758-2350 or send me a response e-mail at
    mtelle@velaw.com.

    Dear Ken,

    I'd like to thank you for your continued participation in this project.

    I thought it would make sense to quickly recap where we are following last
    week's meeting.

    1. We will redraft the report to reflect several trains of thought.  We
    will, for example, express a greater appreciation for the fact that there
    are major problems with the current financial reporting framework, a big gap
    between GAAP and the real world in which investors must make their
    judgements.  We will devote much more attention to the issue of intangibles,
    including the need for a common language to describe them.  We will
    elaborate on the issue of the environment for disclosure, suggesting that we
    need a way of thinking about the concept of safe harbor, one which is based
    on the notion that the way to protect investors amid so much uncertainty is
    to make it easier for companies to provide forward looking information,
    knowing that no one can be fully confident of any projections these days.
    We will be much bolder in recommending several groups - the SEC, FASB,
    institutional investors - take a much greater interest in the deficiencies
    of the reporting model and ask the questions, commission the studies, etc.

    All of this will still be within the framework of the spirit of the last
    draft - that is, we're against more regulation at this time, against
    prescriptive one-size-fits-all mandates, etc.  And we believe that the
    market is forcing disclosure already - but maybe not quickly or
    comprehensively enough.

    2. Some of the panel members will have supplementary views.  Can you
    begin to put pen to paper now?  Here is my speculation as to who may want to
    say what:

    * Len Baker and Rob Glaser may wish to write something on the recent
    "Fair Disclosure" decision.  I sense that Dennis Powell might wish to join.
    Len, can you take the lead?  I'd suggest no more than one page, preferably
    half a page.

    * John Neff may wish to express skepticism about the value of
    developing a new language for intangibles.

    * John Doerr and Len Baker may wish to say something about accounting
    for pooling or stock options.  Again, please keep it very short.  John, can
    you take the lead?

    If anyone else is thinking about a supplementary view, please let me know.
    We would appreciate these submissions by October 15.

    3. Future Schedule.  We agreed to "get it right" and not to stop until
    we do.   The next steps, it seems to me are:

    * Get you a new draft
    * Get your views either in a meeting or conference call to be
    scheduled
    * See where we are then

    However, I'd like to suggest that we aim to finish this report by December
    15, 2000 if at all possible.

    Please let me know if I've missed anything or if you have additional ideas.

    Best regards,
    Jeff

  subject: Transactions in Lilly Stock
  text: |
    This is a reminder of your ongoing obligation to report to the Securities
    and Exchange Commission ("SEC") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of
    the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe
    penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any
    transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,
    including:

    -   purchases
    -   sales
    -   gifts
    -   trust or partnership transactions
    -   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
    -   exchange fund transactions

    We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
    reasons:

       There are certain times when you should not engage in market
       transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these "black-outs" occur around
       the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
       announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of "inside
       information" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
       reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
       While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
       you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
       legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

    2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

    If you had any Lilly stock transactions in September, please advise me as
    soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
    and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").  The
    reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
    of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
    not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
    proposed transaction.

    If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
    to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

    We need a utility/energy company referral.

    We are an early stage e-commerce company that offers the
    world's largest selection of wildlife merchandise. We are ready
    to obtain our first round of financing.  We would like
    to have 5 co-branding partners who would receive equity positions in
    our company.  We would incorporate their logo throughout our site and
    include their PR materials with each order shipped.  Target partners
    would include the utility and energy companies.  Since your
    company is active in this market, you may know of someone who can assist
    us.

    We see utility/energy companies as a compatable fit because of their
    interest in projecting a positive wildlife/environmental image.

    About our company:

    WildlifeCollectibles.Com is a specialty catalog company featuring
    wildlife merchandise.  We have the world's largest selection of wildlife
    merchandise.  Currently in the wildlife merchandise niche
    there are no entities offering broad merchandise selections for each
    animal specie.  We are filling this void by operating 22 "sub-niche"
    stores under the WildlifeCollectibles.Com brand.  These 22 storefronts
    will represent 105 wildlife species.  Seven of these storefronts are
    operational and the backend inventory systems are complete for the other
    15.  We are in the process of loading them on the Internet.

    One major component not yet installed on our site is our "Facts About
    the Specie" page.  We will have reference information available for
    every wildlife specie listed on our site.  At present,
    there is no central repository of reference material available for most
    species.  Britanica.com has reference information available for only 11
    species.  This will attract school age children with their parents
    tagging along.

    We are looking for a total of 5 million dollars.  In order to assist
    companies in purchasing an equity position/co-branded arrangement with
    us, we are willing to finance their investment.  We will take $25,000.00
    a month for 40 months from 5 corporate partners.  This will allow them
    to budget the expense through Public Relations or Marketing.

    I hope I have given you enough information to understand what
    we would like to do, so you can either assist us or point us in the
    right direction.  We would pay a commission and provide a small equity
    stake in our company to the individual who signs on the utility/energy
    companies for us.

    Subject: i2 NETWORK DEAL IS SIGNED !\n\nHello --\n\nWe have i2's signature on
    the VBN network contract.  The contract is a 3-year \nVBN deal covering certain
    i2 locations in the U.S., Europe, Asia, and India.  \nThe TCV of the deal is $14.8
    million.\n\nThis is one of the first major external VBN deals for Enron and has
    been \ninstrumental in shaping the VBN offering.  It also brings an anchor network
    \nclient to our Tokyo and India sites.  The interactions with i2 on this \nagreement
    have also contributed to our understanding of which BOS features \nare most desired
    by customers.\n\nThe i2 deal is the result of a lot of hard work and persistence
    by a number \nof folks throughout EBS and other Enron groups.  Just about everyone
    in EBS' \nTechnology Channels Group contributed to the i2/Enron relationship that
    \nculminated in the network deal.  Particular thanks to Mike Haney who led the
    \nteam through multiple iterations of the deal structure.  Special thanks to \nDavid
    Berberian, Erin Wesling, and Brad Harris who spent lots of time on the \ncontract
    and the network design work with i2.  Thanks also to LaRence \nSnowden, Tony Gilmore,
    and Beaven Fernandez of TDS, Steve McCarrel of Legal, \nWayne Gardner of Tax,
    and Laura Leibman of Regulatory who helped throughout \nthe course of the deal
    structuring and to  Everett Plante, Larry Ciscon, and \nKenny Burroughs and their
    teams who provided input on BOS and network \ntopics.  In addition, thanks to
    the Enron India team who supported the deal \nthroughout the design and negotiation
    process.\n\ni2 has remarked often on the professionalism and collaborative spirit
    of the \nEnron team throughout this process.  Enron is now i2's preferred network
    \nprovider, and we are poised to provide the rest of i2's data network \nworldwide
    as soon as the design specifications are completed by i2.  Thanks \nagain to the
    entire team on your success.  Best regards.\n\n-- Rex\n"

    call \nfrom James (Jimbo) Moffet (504) 582-4000.  He is Chairman of Freeport McMahon
    \nin New Orleans.  James had mentioned to Thomas Boettcher & Michael Hutchinson
    \nin our Metals group that he knew you and wanted to make sure you were \nsupportive
    of our discussions with them.  Here is the background on a \npossible acquisition
    that we have brought up with them:\n\n            Enron Metals is very interested
    in pursuing further discussions \nwith Atlantic Copper on the acquisition of their
    smelter in Spain.  Estimated \ncapital would be US$350 Million.  Acquiring this
    asset gives us the \nopportunity to build copper and copper concentrate positions
    and more \neffectively managing our positions in the market place. We would finance
    this \noff balance sheet.\n\n Mr. James Targetta, head of Atlantic Copper (copper
    smelter and refinery in \nSpain and fully owned by Freeport McMoran) had a conversation
    with James \nMoffet, Chairman of Freeport McMoran last Friday informing him about
    our \npreliminary conversations.   Moffet advised Targetta not to proceed further
    \nuntil he speaks to you since he has known you for 25 years.  \n\n In addition,
    Targetta mentioned the possibility for Enron purchasing all the \ncopper mining
    activities of  Freeport McMoran which would leave them as an \noil and exploration
    company.\n\nWe think there are some great possibilities here.    \n\nIf you have
    not heard from him in the next few days, I would really \nappreciate you giving
    Moffet a call.   I would be more than happy to get a \nmore extensive briefing
    for you if you think you need it.   I look forward to \ndiscussing this further

  text: "Mr. Lay,\n\nI wasn't able to get my question to you at the all employee meeting.
    It was \nthis:\n\nThe Enron sponsored Houston mini-cart Grand Prix entry placed
    second and \nreceived free air time of \"Enron\" on the news. With NASCAR being
    as popular \nas it is today, itself a multi-billion dollar industry, why hasn't
    Enron \nsponsored a racing team to compete against the other Fortune 500 sponsors?
    \nEnron is supporting stadiums, but why not a competition based on fuel, \nenergy,
    and the most powerful being the victor?\n\nNow with cigarettes and alcohol banned
    from advertising, companies such as \nAOL, Compaq, Southern Company, and Infoseek
    are on the tracks. Each race \nwould provide more airtime of the Enron logo and
    further placement of \"The \nNew Power Company\" in the retail consumer/viewer's
    venue. It would also give \nme someone to \"root\" for.\n\nKelly Merritt\nAsset

    Dear Sir,

    I understand that Enron has just terminated
    negotiations with regard to leasing some 1.5 million
    sq.ft. of space at Canary Wharf in London.

    I would like you to consider the London Dome. This has
    sufficient space for all your needs, would provide a
    high profile location, and I can put together a
    package which would be financially extremely
    beneficial to Enron.

    Please reply to me at samberkovits@yahoo.com

    Rice,\n\nThank you very much for meeting us on October 13.\nI think Ronnie has
    already left you a brief message about eAccess. Let me\nfill you in with some
    more background information about us.\nI am the founder of DDI (the second largest
    wireline and wireless private\ntelecom operator in Japan). Today's DDI market
    capitalization is around $20\nbillion. I left DDI at the end of 1995 and became
    a professor and Keio\nUniversity Business School for 4 years. I have also been
    an active member in\nthe government telecom deregulation committee. I left Keio
    University last\nyear and founded eAccess in November 1999. With less than one
    year in\noperation, eAccess has already established a strong presence in the Japanese\ntelecom
    market. We have three phases in our long-term business plan, (1)\nbroadband access
    network; (2) CSP and ASP streaming related business; (3) IP\nmetropolitan backbone
    infrastructure business. As we are currently looking\nfor the best global strategic
    partner to achieve the goal together, we\nbelieve that Enron could become a strong
    potential partner in Japan.\n\nIf you need any more information about eAccess,
    please do not hesitate to\ncall or email me.\nI am looking forward to seeing you
    on October 13.\n\nRegards\n\nDr. Sachio Semmoto\n\nPS : Please advise me email

    GOP Activists\nFr Ken Hutcheson\nRe George W. Bush Debate Win/Al Gore's Lies\n\nI
    hope you got a chance to see the debate last night.  George W. Bush did a\nvery
    good job articulating his message and debating Al Gore.\n\nI am sure it will come
    as no surprise to you that Al Gore could not go the\nentire debate without telling
    a lie.  In fact, two lies have been exposed so\nfar.\n\nThe first one was Gore's
    claim that he visited Texas with FEMA Director,\nJames Lee Witt, after the bad
    Texas floods and tornadoes.  As it turns out,\nthat was a lie.  Al Gore on the
    morning news shows today claimed that he\nthought he had, but it must have been
    another state.  Go figure.\n\nThe next lie exposed is as follows:\n\nNews radio
    970 WFLA interviewed the principal of Sarasota High this morning.\nHe said that
    the girl that Gore was talking about had no desk for exactly\none day.  It was
    the first day of class and they were still making\nadjustments to the kids class
    schedule and that particular classroom was\nbeing refurbished.  The teacher only
    had to call the office and get her a\ndesk because they have plenty of desks there.
    \ Apparently there is a picture\nthat was sent to Gore of her standing in class
    or something like that\nbecause the Principal mentions that in the picture of
    her there is $100,000\nof new equipment behind her.\n\nPlease pass this along
    to your friends and family and any undecided voters.\nThe more people who realize
    that Al Gore is a pathological liar, the better\nGeorge W. Bush will do.\n\nPlease
    check out the two links and cast your vote for George W. Bush as the\nwinner in
    last night's debate:  http://news.excite.com/news/poll/ or\nhttp://www.cnn.com/\n\nLast
    but not least....Have you done everything you can do to elect George W.\nBush?
    \ Have you made a small contribution to Victory 2000?  Have you\nparticipated

  subject: A Harvard conference
  text: |
    Ken, we met a while back--'94 or so--when I was editor of Fortune. It's in
    my current incarnation, though, as Editorial Director for the Harvard
    Business School Publishing Co. and head of its publishing division--we
    publish the Harvard Business Review, HBS Press books (including Leading the
    Revolution from your friend and skiing companion Gary Hamel), and the best
    selling management newsletter in the country, among other things--that I
    wanted to put a proposition before you to see if we might interest you in
    what I think may be an important idea-development and publishing
    opportunity.
    HBSPC has become quite interested in the subject of corporate venturing, of
    how companies can invest in innovation and new organizational forms (but you
    know all about that) in a transformative way, so much so that we're planning
    to put on a couple of conferences on the subject next year. (The purpose of
    our conferences, in general, is to push ideas ahead and advance the thinking
    on a particular topic.) They will be smallish, half-day affairs--we're
    looking at an audience of perhaps 75 senior executives at each--one in New
    York in January, the second in San Francisco, probably the first week in
    February. As with the authors of the books and HBR articles that we publish,
    we're committed to having only top-flight experts on the program, mostly on
    panels. (For instance, we're talking with the Harvard Business School
    professors who teach the executive education course on corporate venturing
    about their serving on and putting together one of the panels.) And we, of
    course, thought of you and Enron--who knows more about the subject? As we've
    designed the conferences, we've concluded that a great way to begin the
    program would be to have a sort of a keynote from a CEO grounded in the
    real-world experience of making this happen. But we don't want to impose on
    your time, or that of your staff, to put together a speech. Our thought was
    to have the session be more like "A conversation with...", wherein an
    interlocutor (probably me, but maybe assisted by a couple of others) would
    put questions to you, and draw you out on the points you thought important.
    We could confer on the questions beforehand as much or little as you'd like.
    Ken Chenault of American Express has agreed to play this role at the New
    York conference. We'd wondered if there were any possibility of interesting
    you in it for the San Francisco conference? Enron has the best record of any
    company on this front, and my secret hope is that the conversation might
    serve as the basis of an article (or even the first step toward a book?)
    that HBSP might eventually publish. We know, too, that you have endless
    demands on your time, and if it would help you to think more favorably of
    using it in this way, we'd be happy to provide an honararium for the charity
    or charities of your choice.
    I'm sure you're besieged with emails on your return from vacation,  but if
    you have a moment to marinate on this, we'd welcome the chance to answer any
    questions you might have about the event. I have two offices and two phone
    numbers (New York, Monday, Tuesday, and most Fridays, at 212-872-9281,
    Boston the rest of the week at 617-783-7535) but the most efficient way for
    your office to schedule a conversation might be to have them be in touch
    with Maria Carnevale here in New York at 212-872-9285) or just shoot me back
    an email.
    Thanks for taking the time for this overlong email. Our eyes are beginning

    Dear Messrs. Lay, Skilling and Rice,

    Thank you very much for your accepting us.

    I have received an e-mail from Sherri, confirming our
    forthcoming meeting with Messrs. Skilling and Rice at
    9:00 am, October 13th in Mr. Skilling's office in Houston.

     I, our COO, Eric Gan and our CTO, Yoshihiro Obata will be there
    to explore the possibility of potential strategic alliance between
    Enron and eAccess in IP/telecom business in Japan.

    In spite of such a short notice,  I deeply appreciate your
    generosity to accept us with the introduction of my friend,
    Mr. Ronnie Chan who is serving your board.  When you
    have a chance to see him very soon in Florida, please
    send my best regards to him.

    Mr. Skilling's assistant, Sherri has been quite efficient to
    handle this procedure, which I also appreciate.

    We look forward to seeing Messrs. Skilling and Rice
    next week.

    Best regards,

    Sachio

    Ken,

    I will be in Houston all day on Wednesday, Oct. 25 en route to Monterrey for
    a Board Meeting on Oct. 26 and thought of how long it has been since we last
    met.

    If there is any chance you could fit me into your busy schedule for 15
    minutes, I would be very appreciative.  As you may recall, I now manage
    Darby - the emerging markets investment firm created by Nick F. Brady in
    1994.

    We have launched a number of new investment vehicles for Latin America.  Our
    Latin American Mezzanine Fund aimed at helping finance infrastructure
    projects is still the only one of its kind in the Region.  There should be
    some interesting opportunities for Enron and Darby to work together.

    I look forward to hearing from you.

    Best personal regards,

    Richard H. Frank

    My interests are primarily business development.  Although an engineer by
    training, I have been in the business and operations side for the last 20
    years.  My main area has been natural resources and energy.  I also enjoy
    strategy work, and apparently am good at it, judging by the results from the
    international plan I did as the first ever VP, International at Westcoast
    Energy.

    > One item of note regarding project feasibility - while I ran Westcoast
    > Energy's Asia business development and operations, we invested (with
    > partners) over $600 MM US in five years with a total staff of 5 (including
    > clerical), and a write-off rate of 0.14% of capital invested - possibly a
    > record low.   I have good systems for risk review and mitigation, and  to
    > screen projects, countries, partners, and  agents.

    With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=

    ClickAtHome
    program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
    technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
    =20
    click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=

    We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
    =20
    the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
    =20
    case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
    =20
    computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
    ClickAtHome includes the following:

    ? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
    =20
    disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
    =20
    software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
    =20
    connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
    ? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
    =20
    and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
    =20
    however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=

    Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
    accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
    employed at the time of implementation. =20
    ? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
    =20
    the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
    ry=20
    of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

    Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=

    Re: CNBC Advance Notice: Decimal-based Pricing


    I want to advise you that as of this Monday, Aug. 28, CNBC will begin
    displaying all quotes and price changes in decimals (dollars and cents)
    instead of fractions.

    As you know, the securities industry as a whole is headed towards decimal -
    based pricing.  Both the NYSE and the NASDAQ plan to gradually change over
    to decimals to comply with the SEC's mandate of total decimal conversion by
    April 9, 2001.  By making the full move to decimals all at once, we are
    preparing CNBC viewers for this eventual industry-wide changeover.

    I welcome any comments from you or others in your organization about these
    changes or other aspects of CNBC coverage.   Please let me know if you would
    like to be removed from our ongoing notification list or add others in your
    organization.

    When you click on the link below you will be able to see four summary slides
    that illustrate our new decimal-based formats, as they will appear on
    Monday, and access a form to provide feedback..

  text: |+
    To the attention of:
    Dr Kenneth L. Lay
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
    ENRON CORPORATION

    Dear Dr Lay,

    While it appears that the US economy is moving towards the much-talked
    about 'soft-landing', there are nevertheless imbalances - particularly the
    severe shortage of labor and surging trade deficit - which have given
    global business leaders reason to be wary. Add to this scenario the new
    political landscape, and the recent hike in oil prices, and there is every
    reason to pay close attention to the USA in early 2001.

    Taking place within the first 100 days of the new Administration, the USA
    Meeting 2001 will bring together key members of the cabinet and
    congressional leadership, several hundred chief executives from over forty
    countries, as well as renowned experts and media leaders. In our usual
    Davos-style interactive discussions, we will analyse the current state of
    the world's largest market against the backdrop of the global economy.

    Held in collaboration with the National Chamber Foundation, the USA Meeting
    takes place at the headquarters of the US Chamber of Commerce, across from
    the White House. The Meeting is widely recognised as the premier Washington
    event for business leaders from the United States and around the world.

    A full brochure will be sent to you after the election but wanted to take
    the opportunity to inform you at this early stage so you can already block
    April 4-5, 2001 on your agenda. I hope that I will have the pleasure of
    welcoming you in Washington, DC next April, and look forward to hearing
    from you soon.

    For further information, please do not hesitate to contact Chantal
    Humbert-Droz at (41 22) 869 1442 or e-mail: usameeting@weforum.org. You may
    also consult our website, http://www.weforum.org/usa, where information will

  text: "This message contains the latest issue of the CSIS Watch, focusing on Energy
    \nTrends and Geopolitics.\n\nFor further information, contact the CSIS Director
    of Studies Office at \n202-887-0200, or reply to this e-mail.\n*********************************************\n\nEnergy
    Trends and Geopolitics.\n\nThe OPEC heads-of-state summit should be appraised
    on three different levels, \naccording to Luis Giusti, CSIS senior adviser. Despite
    speculation that \ndecisions about the market would be forthcoming, nothing was
    bound to happen \nbecause the operational agenda will be dealt with in the organization's
    \nmeeting in November. At the institutional level, the summit was undoubtedly
    a \nsuccess for OPEC, as it clearly reinforced the spirit of the organization
    by \nstrengthening the union among member countries. Additionally, at the \npolitical
    level the meeting provided a platform for Venezuelan president Hugo \nChavez to
    deliver what has become his \"north-south\" position and message. It \nis important
    to keep in mind, though, that Saudi Arabia's dominance and \nleadership will continue,
    by virtue of its high production capacity, and we \ncan expect continuity in its
    pragmatic approach toward the market and the \nprice of oil. As a result, Chavez's
    speeches should be viewed in perspective \nand not overplayed.\n\nAs for the United
    States' release of 30 million barrels of oil from the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve
    (SPR), Giusti says that the move has clearly \nprovoked an immediate reaction
    in the desired direction, with oil prices \nfalling some $5 per barrel. In tapping
    the SPR at this moment, the U.S. \naction denotes a mode of cooperation and not
    confrontation. OPEC countries \nhave already increased production significantly,
    and they have repeatedly \nsent the message that they have done their part and
    somebody else has to do \nsomething to bring down prices. The move comes too late,
    however, to bring \nany relief to the winter's tight oil heating situation: aside
    from the fact \nthat the U.S. refining network is operating at practically full
    capacity, the \noil released will not be refined before December, and, as a result,
    the \nrefined products will not start reaching the market before January. But
    the \nmove does have an effect on the price of oil, which is the root of the \nproblem.
    As for the Heating Oil Strategic Reserve currently being accrued, \nits small
    size (2 million barrels) can have only a modest impact on prices. \nMoreover,
    its triggering mechanism is not yet clear.\n\nRobert Ebel, director of the CSIS
    Energy Program, thinks the United States \nshould not touch the reserve. Domestic
    oil producers are finally turning a \nprofit and will be unhappy as crude oil
    prices fall. Moreover, just-in-time \nphilosophies of operation keep stocks low,
    meaning the inventories simply \nwill not be there if demand rises sharply this
    winter despite the release of \nreserves. Ebel suggests that New England take
    steps to diversify the kinds of \nfuel consumed during the winter.\n\nAccording
    to Ebel, the reserve withdraw is playing to the psychological part \nof the market
    more than anything else. After the announcement of the reserve \nwithdraw, prices
    began to drop without a single new drop of oil entering the \nmarketplace. What
    will happen next August when it is time to replenish the \nreserve, wonders Ebel.\n\nMoreover,
    U.S. refineries are already operating at 95%-96% capacity daily. To \nmake room
    in the refineries for the reserve oil, the United States will have \nto give up
    some of the oil it imports. This crowding out of imports will \nbring down prices
    elsewhere, notes Ebel. The United States is therefore \nsubsidizing foreign consumers.
    Ebel says the United States should have \ncoordinated the reserve withdraw with
    other countries if it truly wanted to \nhave a global impact on prices.\n\nTurning
    to Iraq, the high price of oil contributes to the erosion of the \nsanctions in
    place. Iraqi oil now plays a key role in global supplies and \nprices. This gives
    the Iraqi regime increased leverage, says Charles Duelfer, \na visiting fellow
    in the CSIS Middle East Program.\n\nWhile Iraq is unlikely to actually halt its
    oil exports, the potential to do \nso provides Iraq with a \"deterrent force\"
    of some significance. Iraq made \nmodest reductions in output earlier this year
    when the UN sanctions committee \ndelayed approval of funding for oil infrastructure
    repairs. The Iraqi regime \nhas a great appreciation of power-whether through
    weapons of mass destruction \nor through oil. Iraq can be expected to take every
    opportunity to increase \nits production capacity as circumstances permit, perhaps
    with an ultimate \ngoal of displacing Saudi Arabia as OPEC's dominant player.\n\n

    hope you got some vacation in \nAspen.? I'm working at it! \n\nRosalie said you'd
    be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you \nby phone or e-mail
    before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you. \nGovernor Knowles (classmate
    of George W.), along with Governor Taft of \nOhio, has enlisted us in a conference
    that seven governors are sponsoring \non natural gas in order to elucidate the
    market and issues -- and needs -- \nbefore it explodes as a political issue --
    and perhaps helps head it off \n(in contrast to what happened with gasoline).?
    Governor Knowles is the \ncurrent chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission,
    and it will be \nunder the auspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven
    governors and \na lot of other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this
    is a very \ntimely event. \n\nThey would like to invite you to be the luncheon
    speaker.? (I will be \nkicking off the conference).?? It looks to be a very good
    and high \nvisibility platform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and
    \nhonored -- to have you in that featured role in it works for your schedule.
    \n\nIt takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. \n\nTony is a very good
    guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms \nvery large for him.? You'll
    enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill \nyou in further on what they would
    like to accomplish. \n\nIf it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule
    and interest, \nthat would be great. \n\nOn behalf of the governors, thank you
    for the consideration. \n\nBest, \n\nDan \n\n\n"

  subject: Message from Congressman Sessions
  text: "From:  Pete\n\nTo:  Ken\n\nDate: Friday, October 6, 2000\n\n\nTHE HILL REPORT\nA
    Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions\nWeek of September 30 - October
    6, 2000\n\n\nThis Week in Washington, the United States House of Representatives\ncontinued
    its work on the appropriations process for funding of the\nfiscal year of 2001.
    \ The House passed the conference reports on\nthe energy, interior and transportation
    appropriations bills.   We\nalso passed a continuing resolution agreement that
    will keep the\ngovernment running until all 13 appropriations bills are passed
    and\nsigned into law by the president.\n\nOn Monday of this week, as Chairman
    of the Congressional Results\nCaucus and a member of the Congressional Cyber Security
    Caucus, I\ntoured the high-tech corridor of Boston, Massachusetts today to learn\nabout
    high-tech issues such as information security, e-signature\nlegislation and Internet
    taxation.\n\nI organized the trip to draw attention to the need for more implementation\nof
    information technology security not only among federal and other\ngovernmental
    agencies but in the private sector as well.  The Congressional\nCyber Security
    Caucus exists in part to educate other members of\nCongress and government agencies
    of the vital need for secure information\ntechnology systems.\n\nThe trip came
    on the heels of a recent General Accounting Office\n(GAO) report to Congress that
    clearly stated that too many government\noperations and assets remain at risk
    of cyber attack.  The GAO discovered\nserious security flaws at major federal
    agencies such as the Treasury\nDepartment and the Department of Defense - situations
    clearly indicating\nlarge potential threats to citizen privacy and national security.\n\nSome
    of the computer systems that run our national defense and military\noperations
    are literally an open target to hostile nations or terrorists\nwho have cyber
    terrorism technology.  Both accidental and intentional\nattacks on these very
    systems have been detected and we must take\nsteps to stop them.\n\nI was joined
    by Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier (R-CA), Congressman\nTom Davis (R-VA),
    Congressman Pete Hoekstra (R-MI), Congresswoman\nNancy Johnson (R-CT), Congressman
    John Sununu (R-NH), Congressman\nJack Quinn (R-NY), Congressman John Sweeney (R-NY),
    and other prominent\nbusiness, community and financial leaders.\n\nWe attended
    a meeting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nwith area CEOs and high-tech
    leaders, representing the financial,\ncommunications and technology community.
    \ The discussion was hosted\nby TechNet Massachusetts to discuss creating digital
    opportunities,\nH-1B visas, protection of online privacy, and taxation of Internet\ntransactions.\n\nI
    believe that any government agency using information systems and\nis linked to
    the outside world MUST have an efficient and secure\ninformation security system.
    \ The potential privacy and security\nthreat is not something we should take lightly
    and unfortunately\ntoo many high-level government officials are doing just that!\n\nAny
    major business, industry or government organization must consider\nthe threat
    of cyber attack and how it could be a devastating situation\nto customers and
    citizens.  I can't imagine any of my constituents\nbeing interested in having
    their private banking information being\nmade public to anyone on the Internet.
    \ Security and privacy must\nbe a priority and the businesses and organizations
    that possess this\nsensitive information can not afford the risk of intrusion.\n\nMembers
    also met with high-tech officials, Governor Paul Cellucci\n(R-MA), and Lt. Governor
    Jane Swift (R-MA) to discuss the future\nof the information technology industry
    as well as pending legislation\nin Congress designed to address the pressing needs
    of New Economy\ncompanies.\n\nEarlier this year, I digitally signed the \"The
    e-Contract 2000\" with\nhigh-tech America to renew his commitment to promoting
    the New Economy\nin the 21st century.\n\nI pledge to continue my legislative and
    oversight efforts to remove\nthe barriers to future innovation, competition, and
    growth.  Freedom\nis the answer, not government intervention.\nThe New Economy
    has created limitless opportunities in America today\nfor consumers, companies
    and workers alike.\n\nThe e-Contract 2000 outlines a number of policies the Republican-controlled\nCongress
    has designed to promote continued growth in the New Economy,\nsuch as \"Reducing
    Taxation, Regulation, and Litigation\" and \"Promoting\nFree Trade and E-Commerce.\"\n\nAlso
    this year I voted for continued growth in the new economy by\nsupporting the \"Internet
    Non-Discrimination Act\" (H.R. 3709), to\nextend the current Internet tax moratorium
    for an additional 5 years,\nthrough 2006.  The bill passed in the U.S. House of
    Representatives\nby a vote of 352-75.\n\nThe tremendous growth of e-commerce has
    created thousands of high-wage\njobs in this country and has led to countless
    new choices for Texas\nconsumers.  The group with me today believes the New Economy
    should\nremain unfettered by burdensome taxes and regulation, to ensure continued\ngrowth
    and innovation into the 21st century.\n\nAround Texas...\n\nLast Friday, I spoke
    to the advanced placement Government and Economics\nclasses at Palestine High
    School.  I pointed out to them that our\nConstitutional form of government is
    really just an on-going experiment,\nand that the continued success of our country
    depends on the participation\nof all of our citizens.  I told them that I am confident
    that we\ncan solve every problem in America.  I always enjoy speaking with\nenthusiastic
    young people, and I want to give every student an opportunity\nto experience and
    understand our government.\n\nOn Saturday I went to the St. Thomas - Aquinas children's
    carnival,\nand that evening I attended a fundraising event to benefit \"For the\nLove
    of the Lake.\"  This is one of my favorite community projects.\n I have adopted
    part of the shoreline of White Rock Lake, and would\nencourage all of you to come
    help out at our \"Second Saturday Clean-up.\"\n See my web site for more information.\n\nTomorrow
    I will see my friends in Anderson County at the Anderson\nCounty Cattle Baron's
    Ball.  And in two weeks, I will be in Bryan\nfor a Town Hall Meeting.  See the
    notice at the end of this e-mail.\n\nNext week Congress is hoping to finish its
    work on the budget for\nfiscal year 2001.\n\nHave a great weekend! - Pete\n\n\n>>>

  text: |
    Dear Chamber Members,

    I wanted to take quick moment to report to you on the great
    progress we have made over the past few months in our effort
    to elect a pro-business Congress.

    The U.S. Chamber PAC has been actively involved in dozens of
    important races across the country. We believe these races will
    make the difference on November 7th in electing a Congress that
    will work with us to find solutions, rather than more
    regulations, to challenges when they arise.

    Now, we need your help to continue this important work. During
    the next 5 weeks, the U.S. Chamber PAC will continue to support
    these candidates through direct contributions, endorsements,
    newspaper ads, direct mail, and even radio and television
    campaigns when appropriate.

    You can help today by making a personal contribution to the
    U.S. Chamber PAC. To make this contribution now, please:

    1. Complete the U.S. Chamber PAC solicitation form that
    allows us to solicit contributions from you and your
    organization's executive and administrative employees.
    Simply click here
    - http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/_pacform.htm,
    print the form, sign it and fax it back to the Chamber.

    2. After completing the PAC solicitation form, Click on
    the following for our secure contribution page to make your
    contribution.
    https://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Login.cfm?AID=GGOHCEJNZCHG.

    Also, during the next 5 weeks, Tom Donohue will be traveling
    across the country to attend campaign events on behalf of the
    candidates we support. We will continue to keep you updated
    on these events and hope you will come out to show your support
    for these pro-business candidates when he is in your area.

    However, we need to make sure the U.S. Chamber PAC is able to
    completely fund our Elections 2000 Program. To help us today,
    please complete the solicitation form and then visit our secure
    contribution page at
    https://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Login.cfm?AID=GGOHCEJNZCHG.

    Your contribution of $150, $100, $75, or $50 will make the
    difference this November 7th and help us continue to campaign
    for pro-business candidates who have been there for us when it
    has counted most and who will be there for us in the future.
    The guidelines above are merely suggestions and you may give
    more or less, or not at all without concern of favor,
    disadvantage, or reprisal.

    Thank you and I hope the U.S. Chamber PAC can count on your
    support today!

    Sincerely,

    Bill Miller
    Political Director


    P.S. Contributing to the U.S. Chamber PAC online if quick
    and easy! However, if you have not yet done so, please remember

    As reported Carlos Chacho Alvarez resigned his position Friday as Vice=20
    president of Argentina.=20

    The main reason of this resignation was a political disagreement with Cabin=
    et=20
    changes announced on Thursday 5th by President De la Rua.  Alvarez
    publicly noted he could no longer tolerate the political differences with t=
    he=20
    President over the senate bribery scandal. Particularly Alvarez disagreed=
    =20
    with De la Rua's decision to promote Alberto Flamarique from Minister of=20
    Labor to General Secretary and to keep Fernando de Santiba=0Fez as Chief of=
     the=20
    Intelligence Department.  Both Flamarique and Santiba=0Fez are suspected of=
    =20
    paying bribes to Senators to vote for a new Labor Law. Alvarez has=20
    emotionally championed the fight against the senate scandal and has been=20
    strongly advocating for the resignation of Flamarique, Santiba=0Fez and all=
    =20
    Senators involved in the affair.=20

    It was considered that the decision of De la R?a was intended to demonstrat=
    e=20
    that he, and not Alvarez, holds the power and that De la R?a wanted to=20
    demonstrate that the changes were focused on improving the economic situati=
    on=20
    and to move beyond the Senate scandal.

    The main changes in the cabinet, announced on Thursday 5th, are the followi=
    ng:
    Chistian Colombo (economist, in good relationship with Machinea) will repla=
    ce=20
    Terragno as Chief of Cabinet.
    Machinea (Minister of Economy) will also be responsible of the Ministry of=
    =20
    Infrastructure.=20
    Jorge De la R?a (former General Secretary of the President and President's=
    =20
    brother) will be Minister of Justice.=20
    Patricia Bullrich (peronist) will be Minister of Labor.=20

    As a consequence of Alvarez' resignation, Flamarique resigned to his positi=
    on=20
    of General Secretary of the President.

    Regarding the preliminary impact of the political changes to the economic=
    =20
    situation it could be considered the following:

    Before Alvarez resignation, the cabinet changes were considered positive=20
    intending to increase the power of  the Minister of Economy and reduce the=
    =20
    internal disagreements in the Administration.
    Although Alvarez (the leader of the Frepaso party) said he will be still pa=
    rt=20
    of the "Alianza" (the Radical and Frepaso party alliance) in Office, Alvare=
    z'=20
    resignation could lead to the division of the Alianza and reduce the abilit=
    y=20
    of De la Rua to pass new laws in the Congress. A breakup of the coalition=
    =20
    would make the Peronist the largest party in both houses of Congress only=
    =20
    compounding the potential for government gridlock =20
    This situation will weaken De la Rua and probably foster new re-alignments =
    in=20
    the political field.
    All the situation will increase economic uncertainty and will delay economi=
    c=20
    recovery. The market will wait to see if a conflict develops in the Alianza=
    .
    De la Rua and his team will probably be forced to take "strong" decisions t=
    o=20
    retain the political initiative, strength and control.
    Machinea will probably try to gain the market confidence, announcing that D=
    e=20
    la Rua's Administration will not change the macro foundations of the econom=
    ic=20
    agenda and even increase its commitment toward monetary and fiscal=20
    equilibrium, exchange rate policy, respect for vested rights, etc.

    Financial analysts have viewed the situation as "an institutional crisis wi=
    th=20
    unknown effects on the economy". The insecurity of the Argentina's politica=
    l=20
    future caused Argentine debt paper to fall. The Argentine JP Morgan Emergin=

    Argentina's 17 year global bond fell only slightly. There does not appear t=

    of you talk. \nYou\nused  this  opportunity  to  criticise  bankers  (lenders)
    \ as  you  called \nthem\nreferring  to  them  as  quote \"concrete shoes\" and
    also criticised \npara-statals\ncommenting that \"they never offer to buy you

    of Enron Corporation. Although your \ncv\nindicates  that infact you are part
    of Merrill International. It is not clear \nif\nyou are also an officer of Enron.\n\nI
    \ as  a  Director of HSBC Investment Bank , plus my UK and RSA based \ncolleagues\nhave
    over recent years spent a considerable amount of time and money  \nperforming\nvarious
    \ studies  for  Enron  iro  the proposed MISP and gas export project \nplus\nProject
    \"Sunshine\" etc.  HSBC have not billed Enron for any of this work.\n\nI  had
    the pleasure of meeting  Dr Ken Lay at CERA in February and amongst \nother\nthings
    \ he  referred  to  the  various  problems  Enron had experienced wrt \nthis\nproject
    \ and  stated  that quote  \"Enron do not build steel plants.\"  This \nclear\nand
    \ honest  comment  from  your  boss  is  welcome  and  this is indeed \nEnron's\nprerogative.
    \ What  I  object  to  frankly  is a presentation that maintains \nthe\npretence
    \ of a project and seeks to blame third parties such as lenders and \npara\nstatal
    organisations for difficulties you may have experienced.\n\nI suggest that it
    is in everyone's interest to speak openely and \nconstructively.\nI  for one have
    no problem at all Enron saying that their future is in \nbroadband\nand not in
    steel plants in Mozambique.\n\nIf  anyone  is  interested in my own views as to
    how things could have been \ndone\ndifferently out here I would be delighted to
    let you  or Dr Lay know.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Rhind\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThis

  text: "Ken,\n\nEarlier this year when the decision was made to purchase our new
    GV aircraft, \nwe agreed to move forward with plans to sell one of our Falcon
    900B's by \nyear-end.\n\nThis allows for Aviation to maintain a six aircraft domestic
    fleet, once the \nGV is delivered and operational at the beginning of the 2nd
    quarter of next \nyear.  Our '01 budget forecast is based on this assumption.\n\nA
    year-end sale avoids ad valorem tax issues.  It reduces our fleet to five \nduring
    the 1st quarter, which is also the limit that we can operate aircraft, \ni.e.,
    several pilots unavailable (at GV flight training during this period).\n\nGary
    Fitch advises that Jeff and Joe do not have a preference on which \naircraft to
    sell.  Gary prefers selling the Falcon 900B (#N5733), since it \nhas only one
    lavatory.  The aircraft is 12 years old, in excellent condition, \nand has a market
    value of $20-22 million (lease buy-out of $19 million).\n\nWith your concurrence,
    we will contract with an aircraft broker and place the \nFalcon on the market.\n\nBill"

    available, I'd like to discuss your interest and activities in Spain with
    you.    I'll ask my assistant, Millie, to call your office to see what works
    with your schedule.

  subject: Enron Experience
  text: |+
    Hi Ken,

    I read with interest today about Enron on your corporate web site and your
    recognition as one of the top U.S. CEOs. Such success usually results from a
    history of strong business and customer relationships. With this in mind, I
    felt compelled to bring my one and only experience with Enron to your
    attention.

    I am President, CEO of Xign Corporation located in Pleasanton, CA.  Our
    company is developing software for electronic payments.  Our board of
    directors includes Charles Schwab and Bob Kimmitt (former U.S. Ambassador to
    Germany and President of Commerce One).

    Our company signed an intent last June with Enron to sublease an office
    building.  My team worked in good faith with Enron people for 5 months
    waiting for a draft lease.  During this period we were delayed time and
    again by "lack of legal resources" to complete the contract.  Last month we
    were told that Enron still wanted to lease the space, but the vacancy would
    be delayed one month (from the original October 15th date).  Two weeks ago
    we were told that a November date was at risk and the lease could not be
    signed.

    This week the Enron representative told us (1) there is no occupancy date
    that can be established and (2) Enron is not willing or interested in
    telling us when we they can set a date.  End of conversation.

    Our company has pursued this matter for six months with assurances by Enron
    of their intention to move forward in good faith.  My company is now down to
    100 days in our current lease in a market with very little available space.
    This will materially effect our operation and our shareholders.  Enron did
    not legally commit to the lease. But continued reassurances of the intent to
    sign the lease, misled us.  We won't make a similar mistake in the future.

    We all operate as members of a business community.  I'm sure my experience
    with Enron is not reflective of your organization as a whole. I would
    certainly appreciate if you could have someone look into this matter and
    let us know if there might be a solution to this situation that works well
    for all parties.

    Thank you very much,


    Tom Glassanos
    President, CEO
    Xign Corporation

    Greg and Louise,

    Thanks for taking time out of  your schedule to spend some time with Alph
    Bingham and me this week.  You and your team are breaking new ground in
    your business with impressive speed.  We hope to match that type of
    performance within e.Lilly.

    I had several key takeaways that were notewothy:

    1. Build your e.commerce strategy from the customer's perspective.  Louise,
    you demonstrated this by the intense focus on the traders' requirements for
    EnronOnline.
    2. As Peter Drucker points out in his 1994 article on the "Theory of
    Business", you must have clear assumptions about your environment, mission
    and core competencies.  The establishment of Enron Networks seems to be
    built upon your strong ability to assess a potential market for
    commoditization and then leverage your strong trading capabilities and
    control processes in order to create or redefine the market(eg. pulp/paper,
    steel,bandwidth).
    3. You provide people a chance to understand the business and be
    accountable early in their career.  The example of one of your top traders
    illustrated the performance-based culture that you are developing while
    other examples showed the business breadth that is provided to key talent.
    4. In the new economy (probably in the old one, too), there is no defense,
    only offense.  Again, that mantra seems to grow out of a strong bias for
    action within Enron Networks as you recognize that you must re-create
    yourself (Online gas market) and move aggressively into new ones.
    5. Louise, your EnronOnline initiative epitomized the phrase:  "Ask for
    forgiveness, not for permission."  In other words, get it done; get it done
    right, and the little things - like the budget - will take care of
    themselves.

    Let me know if we can ever return the favor.  Greg, we may want to discuss
    a few risk management questions with you sometime in the future as we are
    building some innovative discovery research ventures that would benefit
    from your insight in this area.

    Thanks again for your time.  Please thank Liz Taylor for us as well.  She
    was very helpful.

    Regards,

    Newt Crenshaw

    Hello Mr. Lay,

    It's been a long time since we've talked.  I'm Priscilla Slade, President of
    Texas Southern University.  The primary purpose of this e-mail is to invite
    you to attend a weekend at the home of President and Mrs. Bush September
    16-18.  So many people have expressed a desire to  know more about the
    University (it's new initiatives and successes) that  President Bush
    volunteered to host a gathering of 25 CEOs and spouses (or a second person
    in the corporate hierarchy).  In addition to having fun golfing, sailing,
    boating, etc., we are presenting ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TEXAS SOUTHERN
    UNIVERSITY.

    The tentative schedule of events is as follows:
    Saturday September 16 - Fun activities (sailing, boating, golf, etc.)
    Sunday September 17 ---- Reception and dinner at the home of President and
    Mrs. Bush
    Monday Morning ------------ ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TSU
    Monday afternoon ---------- Return to Houston

    I know TSU is your favorite topic and we look forward to you joining us.  An
    invitation is in the mail.  I will call you when you return.

    Priscilla

    Ken, my deepest thanks again for attending and speaking at the Davenport
    Society banquet program this Friday night.  At the end of this e-mail is
    your portion of the "script" for this event.  The entire script will be in a
    notebook at the podium.

    Besides introductions (primarily some of our students who will be there),
    the program will include remarks from the chancellor, the induction of new
    members of the Society, announcements of other large new gifts, and some
    musical entertainment.  Jack and Mary Bush of Dallas, Texas are co-chairs of
    the Davenport Society this year.  Both are MU alums.  Jack retired several
    years ago as president of Michaels Store, the large arts-and-crafts
    retailer; he's now involved in retail and e-commerce consulting.

    We will have at least 225 alumni, business people from the area, university
    leaders, faculty, staff, and students in attendance.  A couple reminders:
    It is black tie.  And the event is being held at the Reynolds Alumni Center
    on campus, with reception at 6 and dinner at 7.  We intend/hope to end by
    9:30.

    You will be introduced by Jack Bush.  As you can see below, we have allotted
    about 10 minutes for the keynote talk.  The starting time for your talk is
    approximate, but we strive to stay on schedule.  Last Friday, I responded to
    an e-mail from Rob Bradley regarding your keynote talk.  He indicated that
    he would be preparing the talk.  (Rob, would you confirm that you received
    my e-mail of last Friday.  Thanks.)

    Then we will have another 10 minutes or so devoted to the announcement of
    the Pinkney Walker Professorship.  As you can see, I'll introduce this part
    after thanking you for your keynote remarks.  The professorship plaque that
    will hang in the foyer of Middlebush Hall (and, soon, Cornell Hall) has
    arrived so we will be able to show it to the audience and to Pinkney.  We'll
    have it on stage and I'll hold it while you read the wording (see below).

    If you desire, you can add personal comments about Pinkney after reading the
    inscription on the plaque.  If you want them placed in the podium script,
    just have them sent to me via e-mail; likewise, with any changes or
    corrections to the portion below.  Of course, you can speak extemporaneously
    about Pinkney or bring prepared remarks about him with you.  Then we'll
    allow Pinkney to say a few words.  It should be splendid.

    By the way, during the dinner, you will be seated with Pinkney and his wife
    Sheila, Dulari Mehta (a College of Business student from the Dallas area who
    is hosting the Walkers, who are new Davenport Society members), Richard
    Schwartz (dean of A&S), and Michael Kateman and Lindsay Lopez (both from the
    A&S development office)

    Of course, if you, Rob, or Rosalee have questions, you can call either my
    assistant Carol Ritter or me at 573/882-6688.  See you Friday evening.
    Thanks again.


    8:21 - 8:31  KEYNOTE ADDRESS

    Ken Lay:  [remarks]

    [Bruce Walker joins Lay at podium.]


    8:31 - 8:36  ANNOUNCEMENT OF P. WALKER PROFESSORSHIP

    Bruce Walker: Thank you very much, Ken.

    We are truly honored and grateful that you have returned to Mizzou this
    evening.

    At this banquet two years ago, Ken announced the start of a campaign to
    establish an endowment in the College of Business in honor of Pinkney C.
    Walker.

    Ken, along with Harold Hook and Bob Pugh, agreed to lead the effort to raise
    funds for this endowment.

    Pinkney, would you please come up and join Ken and me.

    Many of you are familiar with Pinkney.

    Those of you who don't know Pinkney probably have 2 questions in mind.

    Are these two Walker guys related?

    And the answer is no.

    Why does Pinkney Walker deserve such as honor?

    Well, let me tell you a little bit about him.

    A native of Graham, Texas, Pinkney's academic degrees include a bachelor's
    from the University of Texas and an MBA and a doctorate from the Wharton
    School at the University of Pennsylvania.

    Pinkney's association with MU dates back to 1940.

    Eventually, he became a professor of economics, who -- according to one
    estimate -- taught as many as 40,000 students at Mizzou.

    Pinkney also served as the college's dean from 1964 to 1971.

    He left the university to become a member of the Federal Power Commission.

    Now, he is enjoying the good life of a professor emeritus, residing in Fort
    Myers, Florida, with his wife Sheila.

    We knew the Pinkney C. Walker Endowment would be dedicated to building
    excellence in the college.

    But we didn't know if the endowment eventually would fund a scholarship or
    two, faculty research, or a faculty position.

    That would depend on how much money was raised.

    Well, tonight, as Paul Harvey would say, Ken is back with the rest of the
    story.

    Ken. . .


    Ken Lay: It is with great pride and pleasure that I can tell you
    tonight that the Pinkney C. Walker Endowment has received gifts totaling
    $550,000, which means it will fund a distinguished professorship in the
    college.

    Here is the plaque that will hang in Middlebush Hall and eventually will be
    moved to Cornell Hall.

    It reads:

    Pinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship
    College of Business

    Established in recognition of Dr. Walker's teaching excellence
    and his significant contributions as dean, public servant, and friend.

    Endowed in 2000 by alumni and friends of the University of Missouri.

    Pinkney, please accept our congratulations.

    Would you like to say a few words.

    [Pinkney Walker comes to podium]


    8:36 - 8:41  PINKNEY WALKER PERSONAL REMARKS

    Pinkney Walker: [Remarks]

    return to seats.]

    New Proposed Air Conditioner, Heat Pump Standards Fall Short

    The new air conditioner energy efficiency standards proposed by the U.S.
    Department of Energy fall short of what's justified and what's needed to
    lighten the load on electricity demand, says the Alliance to Save Energy. In
    a humorous ad campaign developed by the Appliance Standards Awareness
    project and featuring Energy Secretary Bill Richardson in digitally-inserted
    sunglasses, energy efficiency advocates, urge strong air conditioner
    standards. Air conditioners are the largest single contributors to peak
    electricity demand - an issue the past two summers as peak demands created
    and threatened blackouts and brownouts in various locations. This proposed
    legislation is currently in a 60-day public comment period, allowing for
    input from interested parties, after which the DOE will issue the final
    rule.

    Winter Fuel Outlook Bleak, EIA Reveals in New Report

    The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that natural gas prices
    will increase by as much as 40 to 50 percent for consumers this winter over
    last winter, or an average of $240 per consumer home, in its Winter Fuels
    Outlook, released on October 6. Home heating oil prices are expected to rise
    by $190 per home from last year's already high prices in the Northeast,
    while electricity prices could increase by as much as 12 percent.
    Predictions are based on normal winter weather, and prices could escalate
    even further should the weather prove to be colder than normal.

    --------------------------------

    Gains Expected in Federal Budget for Energy Efficiency Programs

    Holding a strong hand due to concerns over sharply rising energy prices and
    low winter natural gas and heating oil inventories, and backed by a strong
    lobbying effort from the Alliance to Save Energy  and others, the Clinton
    administration is expected to win substantial gains for energy efficiency
    programs in recently concluded negotiations with Congressional appropriators
    over the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection
    Agency budget. A total of $814 million is being appropriated for energy
    efficiency research, development and deployment programs, run by the DOE's
    Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, in increase of $94
    million, or 13 percent over the previous budget.

    Energy Heats Up Election

    Each presidential candidate stated his energy policy in the first
    presidential debate in Boston, MA, on October 3. Vice President Al Gore's
    plan focuses on increasing supply and decreasing demand, while Texas
    Governor George W. Bush's plan emphasizes developing domestic energy
    supplies. The vice presidential candidates faced off in Danville, KY on
    October 5, both echoing the positions of their presidential running mates.

    California, New York Make Dramatic Boosts for Energy-Efficiency Funding

    In California, bills signed by Governor Gray Davis last week re-assert
    California's leadership status on support for energy efficiency and other
    clean energy sources. Two bills extend California's system benefits charge
    through 2012, while adding an inflation adjustment, creating more than $5
    billion of investment in clean energy from 2002-2012. This may be the
    largest clean energy fund ever created. A third major bill will speed the
    adoption of cost-effective buildings and appliance standards. These measures
    are expected to maximize peak energy savings for the summer of 2001, and to
    lessen future energy reliability problems.

    To see complete bill texts:

    And in Los Angeles, the City Council approved a 10-year power plan that will
    meet roughly half of the 1000 megawatts of new power capacity with renewable
    energy sources, distributed generation, and demand side management.

    http://www.ase.org/e-FFICIENCY/losangeles.htm

    The New York State Public Service Commission has proposed increasing the
    state's System Benefits Charge from its current $78 million to $139 million
    per year, and extending it for five years. About 70 percent of the current
    $78 million is used for energy efficiency programs. If this formula holds,
    efficiency funding would increase to about $97 million - an 80 percent
    increase from current levels. Energy advocates are seeking SBC funding
    closer to the $200 million level.

    Living Efficiently and Affordably

    The U.S. Department of Energy has partnered with the housing industry
    through the Building American Program to build affordable, highly
    energy-efficient homes throughout the U.S. The Fairburn Commons complex in
    an Atlanta suburb opened with 33 units, each of which will cost less than
    $1/day to heat and cool.

    http://www.doe.gov/news/releases00/seppr/pr00240.htm


    Meanwhile, the National Affordable Housing Network released a report on new
    energy-efficient, affordable homes built in Texas. Built in partnership with
    Habitat for Humanity International, these 40 homes use up to 42 percent less
    energy than an average new home. Reduced monthly energy bills are
    particularly critical for low-income residents.

    This is a great time to be at Enron. The challenges and opportunities at=20
    Enron seem to be expanding with every passing day.  This presents enormous=
    =20
    challenges for Government Affairs as a group and for each of us=20
    individually.  As we discussed at the staff meeting last month, this requir=
    es=20
    us to constantly reevaluate our priorities, our methods of getting things=
    =20
    done, and whether our organization is properly structured to meet the needs=
    =20
    of the entire company.  While we have done an outstanding job as a group=20
    within our current structure, changes are necessary at this time.

    The primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the=20
    assignments for and reinforce the leadership roles of the individuals withi=
    n=20
    the group who have primary responsibility for setting the Government Affair=
    s=20
    strategy and agenda for the respective Enron operating companies.  The belo=
    w=20
    mentioned individuals will have the following responsibilities:

    1. Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets:  Jim Steffes
    2. The Enron Energy Services Group of Companies:  Harry Kingerski
    3. Enron Broadband Services:  Sue Nord
    4. Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks:  Lisa Yoho
    5. Enron South America:  Jose Bestard
    6. Federal Government Affairs:  Linda Robertson

    With the impending retirement on March 31, 2001 of Joe Hillings, I am pleas=
    ed=20
    to announce that Linda Robertson will be joining the office on November 6,=
    =20
    2000, as a Vice President who will immediately assume responsibility for=20
    leading the Federal Government Affairs group in our Washington office.  Lin=

    prior to spending the last eight years with the U.S. Department of Treasury=
    ,=20
    the last five as Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs and Public=20
    Liaison, for Secretaries Rubin & Summers.  Linda brings a terrific=20
    background, both in energy and financial services, and is a welcome additio=
    n=20
    to our team.  In order to more effectively integrate the Government Affairs=
    =20
    groups and strategy in Washington, the Federal Regulatory Affairs group und=

    Joe Hartsoe=01,s direction will also report to Linda.  Joe Hartsoe will als=

    On a personal note, I would like to acknowledge the significant contributio=
    ns=20
    that Joe Hillings has made to this company in his eighteen years of service=
    . =20
    Joe=01,s work ethic, intellect, and integrity have established Enron as a=
    =20
    company that is respected throughout Washington.  I will have more to say=
    =20
    about this as Joe=01,s retirement draws closer, but I look to him to be a v=
    ital=20
    part of the leadership transition in our Washington office that will occur=
    =20
    over the next days and weeks.

    I will be relying heavily on the above-identified six individuals to ensure=
    =20
    that Government Affairs is firmly embedded within each of our operating=20
    companies; that we as a group thoroughly understand their current business=
    =20
    strategies as well as new directions they may be taking in the future; and,=
    =20
    most importantly, to thoroughly understand how our organization can=20

    =20
    Communicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the=20
    Government Affairs organization and developing a Government Affairs wide=20
    execution strategy will be a key objective for each of these individuals.

    In order to ensure the success of these individuals and the Government=20
    Affairs organization; the following changes are being made.

    In addition to his leadership role with Government Affairs on behalf of the=
    =20
    EES group of companies, Harry Kingerski will continue to head up the=20

    and report to Harry.
    Jeff Brown, Tom Delaney, Mary Hain, Ron McNamara, Christi Nicolay, Thane=20
    Twiggs, and Steve Walton will now report to Jim Steffes in his role=20
    supporting Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets. Alberto Levy=

    efforts for Enron will be critical to the development of well functioning=

    wholesale electric markets in the U.S.  It is also my hope that Steve Walto=

    of the electric industry, coupled with his industry-wide credibility, will=

    39\nOctober 10, 2000\n\nWelcome to The Lighthouse, the e-mail newsletter of The
    Independent\nInstitute, the non-partisan, public policy research organization\n<http://www.independent.org>.
    We provide you with updates of the\nInstitute's current research publications,
    events and media programs.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIN
    THIS WEEK'S ISSUE:\n1. Holding Bureaucrats Personally Accountable: A 1st Amendment
    Victory\n2. The Independent Review: Fall Issue Now Available\n3. Public Health
    vs. The Nanny State? -- Next Independent Policy\nForum (10/26/00)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLDING
    BUREAUCRATS PERSONALLY ACCOUNTABLE: A 1st Amendment Victory\n\nThe legal doctrine
    of \"sovereign immunity\" -- and its modern cousin,\n\"qualified immunity\" --
    has historically allowed government\nbureaucrats to escape full accountability
    for misdeeds they have\nperpetrated under the guise of government \"policy.\"
    Thus, a recent\ndecision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals -- ruling that
    a group\nof government bureaucrats may be held personally liable for\noutrageous
    constitutional violations -- is news worthy of celebration.\n\nThe facts of the
    case attest to the need for strong checks on\ngovernment power. Three Berkeley,
    Calif., residents had campaigned\nagainst a proposed homeless shelter in their
    neighborhood. At the\nbehest of local \"housing rights\" activists, who said the
    anti-shelter\ncampaign was discriminatory and violated the Fair Housing Act, the\nU.S.
    Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) got into the\nact. HUD officials
    demanded interviews with the three anti-shelter\nneighbors, told their neighbors
    they had violated the law, and\nordered them to give HUD all materials -- including
    the names,\naddresses and phone numbers of other opponents of the shelter -- that\nthey
    had collected for their campaign. To the \"Berkeley Three,\" HUD's\nharassment
    violated their freedom of speech. To the appeals court,\n\"qualified immunity\"
    of government bureaucrats did not apply here;\nthe Berkeley Three may proceed
    with their First Amendment lawsuit\nagainst the HUD officials and seek monetary
    damages.\n\nThis ruling, although unusual by today's standards, harks back to\nanother
    early legal tradition: the idea that citizens can hold\ngovernment officials personally
    liable for improper conduct. In 1763,\nJohn Wilkes, a member of Britain's parliament,
    was the subject of an\noutrageous search and seizure warrant issued by Secretary
    of State\nLord Halifax, after Wilkes published an anonymous attack on the\ngovernment.
    Wilkes then sued Halifax and other officials and was\nawarded a sum comparable
    to $20 million today. Americans were so\nenraptured with this refutation of unrestrained
    government power that\nthey made Wilkes a hero and followed in his footsteps,
    suing\ngovernment officials for unreasonable search and seizures.\n\nSince the
    19th century, however, this common-law tradition has nearly\nwithered away. The
    creation of the exclusionary rule has replaced\nWilkes's remedy with an inferior
    one. While the exclusionary rule\nbrings some satisfaction to criminals who are
    the subject of\nunreasonable searches and seizures, it does nothing for the innocent.\nFurthermore,
    the 20th century has seen the rise of the doctrine of\n\"qualified immunity,\"
    which the U.S. Supreme Court explains \"seeks to\nensure that [government] defendants
    'reasonably can anticipate when\ntheir conduct may give rise to liability,' by
    attaching liability\nonly if '[t]he contours of the right [violated are] sufficiently\nclear
    that a reasonable official would understand that what he is\ndoing violates that
    right.'\"\n\nThe Ninth Circuit's recent ruling that HUD officials were not acting\nreasonably
    when they violated the First Amendment rights of the\nBerkeley Three is refreshing
    because it rekindles the idea that civil\nliability can be a restraint on government
    power. In an era when\nbureaucratic violations of the rule of law have become
    routine, it is\nan idea long overdue.\n\nFor the Ninth Circuit's opinion, see\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-39-1.html.\nFor

    the mob violence?\n* Are some school-choice proposals more promising than others?\n*
    Have economists been too quiet on Medicare reform?\n* Is taxation morally defensible?\n*
    How did racism affect employment on the early railroads?\n* Why do government
    bureaucracies in general, and public education in\nparticular, produce such deplorable
    outcomes?\n* Why did Reaganomics turn out as it did?\n\nThese topics and more

    HEALTH vs. THE NANNY STATE? -- Next Independent Policy Forum (10/26/00)\n\nBarely
    a day goes by without some news of the latest public health\n\"threat.\" Serious
    health hazards, we are told, lurk around every\ncorner -- in water supplies, air,
    soil, beverages, fast food,\nsecond-hand smoke, cellular phones, and food irradiation,
    just to\nname a handful. And yet, Americans today live longer than ever! Are\nmarkets
    and private decision-making providing the answers? Or are\nthese dangers real,
    immediate, and a legitimate mandate for\ngovernment control? Can we reduce or
    eliminate health risks without\ngovernment dictates? How does politics distort
    perceptions about\npublic health? Will Americans succumb to or rebel against the
    growing\nNanny State's neo-Puritanism and attack on individual choice and\nresponsibility?
    JACOB SULLUM and THOMAS DiLORENZO will discuss these\ntimely and important issues.\n\nSPEAKERS:\n\n

    Dear Mr. Lay,

    Further to my emails dated 22/2/2000 & 14/6/2000 introducing Tata Housing  =
    as=20
    a premium real estate developer in India, and specifically, our commercial =

    s=20
    KnowledgePark  inspite of it being a ready to move in building with all the=
    =20
    facilities required  for a good Call Center.

    A few of these facilities being -

    ?High speed (100 MBPS) data network with switched interconnection  between=

    offices.
    ?Provision for ISDN lines.
    ?5000 line MTNL exchange on campus
    ?Power from Tata Electric Cos, which is 20% cheaper than the  Government=20
    supply.
    ?In addition, a good quality restaurant and 24 hours ATM  facility.
    ?Central Air-conditioning & Building Automation System.

    All these facilities and more were explained to Mr. Edward de Valcourt, =20
    Project Director Communications, Enron Corp., when he visited Technopolis =
    =20

    Dear MaryAnn,

    I was very disappointed to learn today that the Enron Body Shop will be
    raising its rates to $25 per month.  While this may be in line with some
    benchmarking study, one would hope that Enron would seek to outperform its
    peers, given its goal to be rated #1 as best place to work.  Our cross-town
    competitor Williams, where I worked for almost 12 years, has a facility that
    is at least as good as Enron's, and there is no charge whatsoever.  Why
    charge for the use of a facility that promotes Wellness?

    I hope you reconsider this increase, but at a minimum provide a lower rate
    for the occasional user such as myself.  Given my busy schedule I am lucky
    to get there a few times per month, and would happily pay the greater of $5
    per visit or the $25/month fee.  A $25/month fee will simply discourage
    occasional users.

    Please terminate my membership, effective September 1.   I hope that I am
    not alone in voicing my unhappiness with this increase.

    Sincerely,


    Fred Wolgel

    October 11th 2000.

    From : Vivek Menezes
    To   : Mr. Kenneth L. Lay (klay@enron.com)
           Chairman & CEO,
           Enron Corp.

    Dear Mr. Lay,

    Further to my emails dated 22/2/2000 & 14/6/2000 introducing Tata Housing a=
    s
    a premium real estate developer in India, and specifically, our commercial
    complex Technopolis KnowledgePark at Andheri (E), Mumbai.  We have been
    given to understand  that Enron have acquired an additional space in  Kamla
    Mills Compound.  We were surprised to note that Enron did not consider
    Technopolis KnowledgePark inspite of it being a ready to move in building
    with all the facilities required for a good Call Center.

    A few of these facilities being -

    _ High speed (100 MBPS)  data network with switched interconnection
          between offices.
    _ Provision  for  ISDN lines.
    _ 5000 line MTNL  exchange on campus
    _ Power from Tata Electric Cos, which is 20% cheaper than the Government
          supply.
    _ In addition,  a good quality restaurant and 24 hours ATM facility.
    _ Central Air-conditioning & Building Automation System.

    All these facilities and more were explained to Mr. Edward de Valcourt,
    Project Director Communications, Enron Corp., when he visited Technopolis
    KnowledgePark on 16/6/2000.  Inspite of that, we have once again not been
    considered.  I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that we
    currently have approximately 1,00,000 sq.ft. of space available at
    Technopolis KnowledgePark.  We are also in the process of constructing the
    IInd Phase in the same complex which is approximately 60,000 sq.ft. and can
    be made entirely available to you, if required.

    Further, we have another building of approximately 1,00,000 sq.ft. located
    strategically at Kanjurmarg.  This too could be ideal for your requirement.
    We would also like to inform you that Tata Housing has a large land bank an=
    d
    can offer properties to Enron for Call Centres  across the country.
    We request you to once again look into the same and revert to us at the
    earliest.

    Thanking you
    Yours sincerely,
    TATA HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CO. LTD.

  subject: UTC Sales Call
  text: "At UTC's request, yesterday Mike Jackson and I met with Kent Brittan, VP,
    \nGlobal Sourcing, and members of his sourcing group.  As you remember, we \nfirst
    met Kent when Tom White, Dan Leff, Harold Buchanan and I called on him \ntwo years
    ago.  At the time, we presented an early version of a fully bundled \nenergy outsource
    in partnership with Fluor Daniel and a local real estate \nmanagement firm.\n\nOver
    the last two years, UTC attempted various energy procurement strategies, \nfailing
    to execute any.  \n\nBrittan was very pleased with the content of our revised
    proposal yesterday, \nand told us he would be taking the revised partnership strategy
    we discussed \ndirectly to George David, CEO.  \n\nBrittan will also be taking
    the preliminary concept to UTC Corporate \nTreasury, to gain its buy in on the
    financing aspects of the deal required to \nsupport the demand side management
    infrastructure investments it so \ndesperately needs to affect the energy  consumption
    reduction to which David \ncommitted two years ago.\n\nBarring a problem there,
    it appears we have finally engaged UTC in an \nexclusive negotiating relationship
    that would yield a large scale outsource \nof energy supply and demand side investment
    operations in all the UTC \ncompanies, excepting Carrier.    Carrier continues
    to insist it be treated \nseparately, and Brittan has decided to carve it out,
    rather than hold up the \nentire deal.  I think that strategy is part of what
    he will be speaking to \nDavid about.\n\nI requested, and Brittan agreed, that
    Karl Kropic (COO) be the executive \nsponsor.\n\nMike Jackson who has worked on
    and off with UTC over the past 18 months will \nbe the lead Originator for EES
    moving forward."

  text: "Mr. Lay, I am a 59 1/2 year old employee that last saw you at my 25 year
    \naward celebration in Houston in 1993.  Since that time, I have had some \nhealth
    problems that are leading me to retire a little early from Enron, on \nAugust
    31, 2000. \n\n I did not want to leave Enron's active employment until I had the
    \nopportunity to express to you my gratitude.  I have been with Northern \nNatural
    Gas, InterNorth, HNG-InterNorth and Enron for thirty two years and 1 \nmonth.
    \ I can tell you without hesitation, that since you took over our \ncompany in
    the late 80's, it has been the most challenging and exciting time \nthat I have
    spent in my work life.  I had opportunities that I never dreamt \nof and I am
    grateful for the opportunities that I have had.   I started on \nAugust 1, 1968
    as a maintenance helper at the South Omaha location of \nNorthern Natural Gas.
    \ I was a field technician, an O&M Supervisor, a \nDistrict Manager, and presently
    the Manager of the Operations Communications \nCenter in Omaha.\n\nI have admired
    and respected you since the first time we met in Des Moines, \nIowa, shortly after
    the merger.  Without your guidance and direction and the \nmany employee based
    programs you have initiated, I would not be where I am \nfinancially today.  I
    am looking forward to retirement without concern for me \nor my family's future.
    \ The ESOP program was so very important to all of the \nemployees, and the many
    other programs like our \"options\", variable pay \n(bonus) and others make Enron
    a leader throughout the world in employee \nsatisfaction, and we have the awards
    to prove it.\n\nThe employees that I have worked with in these 32 years are the
    bright spots \nfor Enron, not only in the past but also into the future.  We have
    done a \nwonderful job of getting the best of the best.\n\nI hope that I will
    be able to thank you in person and shake your hand once \nmore, perhaps at a future
    shareholders meeting.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRod Williams\n\n\n"

  text: |-
    Dear Ken:

    News stories abound almost daily over the alleged need for
    governments to proscribe various foods, beverages, cell phones, and
    much more.  Yet, Americans are healthier and live longer than ever.
    So, what is the real story here?

    As a result, I am very pleased to invite you to attend the upcoming
    Independent Policy Forum reception and seminar, "PUBLIC HEALTH vs.
    THE NANNY STATE?"

    http://www.independent.org/tii/forums/001026ipf.html

    This program will feature syndicated columnist and Reason Magazine
    senior editor, JACOB SULLUM, author of the book, FOR YOUR OWN GOOD,
    and economist THOMAS DiLORENZO, co-author of the new book, FROM
    PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS.

    The program will be held Thursday evening, October 26th, from 6:30 to
    8:30 p.m., at the Independent Institute's conference center in
    Oakland, California.

    For your review, I am adding below an invitation with further details
    on the program.  Since seating is limited, please make your
    reservations as soon as possible.  For further information, please
    contact me or the Institute's Events Coordinator, Ms. Nichelle
    Beardsley, at 510-632-1366 X118.

    We hope to see you on October 26.

    PUBLIC HEALTH vs. THE NANNY STATE? -- Next Independent Policy Forum (10/26/00)
    http://www.independent.org/tii/forums/001026ipf.html

    Barely a day goes by without some news of the latest public health
    "threat." Serious health hazards, we are told, lurk around every
    corner -- in water supplies, air, soil, beverages, fast food,
    second-hand smoke, cellular phones, and food irradiation, just to
    name a handful. And yet, Americans today live longer than ever! Are
    markets and private decision-making providing the answers? Or are
    these dangers real, immediate, and a legitimate mandate for
    government control? Can we reduce or eliminate health risks without
    government dictates? How does politics distort perceptions about
    public health? Will Americans succumb to or rebel against the growing
    Nanny State's neo-Puritanism and attack on individual choice and
    responsibility? JACOB SULLUM and THOMAS DiLORENZO will discuss these
    timely and important issues.

    SPEAKERS:

          - Jacob Sullum (Syndicated Columnist and Senior Editor, Reason
    magazine; Author, FOR YOUR OWN GOOD)

          - Thomas DiLorenzo (Professor of Economics, Loyola College of
    Maryland; Co-author, FROM PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS: Public Health in
    America)

    About FOR YOUR OWN GOOD:

    "Sullum is meticulously logical, and his conclusions are implicit in
    everything he argues. FOR YOUR OWN GOOD has made us think about
    totalitarianism in this most unlikely context."
          - NEW YORK TIMES

    "Intriguing and worthwhile, this book marshals an impressive array of
    facts and arguments. Thoughtful and articulate."
          - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE

    About FROM PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS: Public Health in America:

    "FROM PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS argues that public health has become a
    bureaucracy that feels the need to perpetuate itself by expanding
    into new areas that are more often than not, just plain 'politically
    correct.'"
          - WALL STREET JOURNAL

    ******E-NEWS THIS WEEK*******

    SONATRACH ASK FOR PATIENCE OVER OZ2 PIPELINE CONTRACTS
    Algiers - Sonatrach has asked bidders to extend until the end of 2000 offers
    made for the $1bn OZ2 pipeline system, designed to extend the capacity of
    the crude oil corridor from the central el_hamra oil field to the Arzew
    terminal west of Algiers. The extension will allow the company more time to
    evaluate the bids
    About six companies/groups are understood to be bidding for the three
    contracts which are estimated to be worth $220-250m each. They include CCC;
    a consortium of Bonatti, with Entrepose and Dragados & Construcciones and
    Bechtel. The first two contracts involve the construction of the pipelines
    with a third contract for six pumping stations. The recent political changes
    in Algeria, combined with internal administrative changes in Sonatrach, are
    said to have contributed to the delay.


    OIL PRICES RISE OVER ISRAELI CONFLICT
    London - Oil prices soared on global markets last night following rising
    tensions in the Middle East.
    London Brent blend futures rose 72 cents to $31.48 but remains short of a
    10-year high $34.98 touched last month. US light crude was up 92 cents at
    $32.79 helped by speculators returning to buy oil after a two-week sell-off.
    Following Saudi Arabia's warning that Riyadh and other Arab states would not
    "watch with their hands tied" if Israel attacked Lebanon or Syria, the cost
    of a barrel of crude went up almost a dollar to $32.79 (o22.60) in New York.
    Earlier the International Energy Agency set alarm bells ringing when it said
    the West was heading into winter with inventories well below the seasonal
    norm.
    Oil prices have retreated from their 10-year peaks last month after pressure
    from the G7 industrial nations on producers to pump more crude and the US
    decision to release 30m barrels from its strategic reserve. After briefly
    dipping below $30, prices have risen amid concerns that demand will exceed
    supply in the coming months, particularly if the violence in Israel leads to
    a broader conflict. Oil prices are seen as a threat to the prospects of low
    inflation in the West, and yesterday's increases spilled over into bond
    markets, where worries about Wall Street and energy shortages had already
    driven yields higher.
    A wave of violence between Palestinians and Israelis over the past 12 days
    has killed at least 90 people, mostly Palestinians.


    BUY-BACK TERMS SET TO CHANGE
    Tehran - In an interview with Petroleum Argus this month, Mehdi Hosseini,
    former Deputy Oil Minister for international Affairs and now Managing
    Director at Kala, the procurement arm of NIOC based in London, indicated
    that future negotiations with foreign oil companies will take place using
    more favourable terms.
    NIOC is reportedly close to implementing a more attractive buy-back formula.
    Since the Islamic Republic re-opened its doors to foreign oil companies in
    1997, executives had quietly bemoaned the buy-back formula as offering small
    capital returns on huge investments. Despite this, Iran's energy buy-back
    projects have so far attracted close to $10bn capital to the Iranian energy
    sector. NIOC argues that it is their duty to negotiate terms favourable to
    its population rather than to foreign entities. It now appears that in the
    face of increased competition for foreign investment from its Gulf
    neighbours, NIOC is prepared to compromise. For further details please visit
    http://www.petroleumargus.co.uk


    TURKIOG' 2000 UPDATE
    London - Please be advised that time is running out to register for TURKIOG'
    2000 conference in Istanbul on 16th and 17th of November. The event,
    supported and endorsed by the Ministry of Energy & Natural Resources, Botas,
    Tupras, TPAO, Directorate of Petroleum Affairs and Petkim, has now attracted
    in excess of 600 delegates according to the organisers, ITE Exhibitions. The
    supporting exhibition has attracted the participation of over 100 companies,
    all of whom want to participate at what will prove to be the country's main
    oil and gas event of 2000.
    The MENA Petroleum Bulletin is pleased to offer you the chance to join us at
    the event and hear the latest presentations from all of the state entities
    and foreign companies involved in the growing oil and natural gas markets of
    Turkey. For further details please send an e-mail to

  subject: Disappointing news
  text: |-
    Ken:

    Very shortly after we spoke, I was informed that we had lost the Enron
    HomePC Program. This is a great emotional blow to us and I am beyond
    disappointed.

    We understood that given our recent  strong performance against Dell, they
    would do anything to embarrass us in our own backyard.  We have very strong
    insight into their intent and knew they would  use this aggressively in
    their PR campaigns.

    However, clearly it was our job to win the business on the merits of the
    individual program and to compete hard for it. We believed that we had a
    creative offer on the table that would create great value for your
    employees. Obviously, we did not perform to your expectations.

    Following is the summary of our activities together which was created before
    we heard the news.

    I pride myself in developing strong executive relationships with our
    customers, and I would welcome the opportunity for us to put our heads
    together in order to look for ways we can move the relationships between our
    two companies to a higher level.

    I also think we should discuss the PR positioning. As a member of our Board,
    and as a leader in the Houston community this will be news and I am hopeful
    we can find a creative way to balance it.

    Again, I accept it was ours to win in the marketplace but regret it had to
    come to this. I look forward to your call.

    M




    From our Enron team:



    * EBS Product and Service Supply Agreement

    Compaq will continue to honor the Product and Service Supply Agreement
    executed on January 18 between EBS and Compaq, whereby Compaq agreed to
    purchase broadband services from EBS (on a take or pay basis) in proportion
    to EBS' purchase of NT servers and attached storage.  It is also important
    to note that we have been actively partnering with EBS on non-contractual
    areas, such as our ongoing technical joint development and marketing efforts
    around the Windows Streaming Media product.  I understand that our teams
    have been working very closely together -- and with Microsoft -- to resolve
    technical issues with Windows Streaming Media and thereby speed EBS' market
    deployment.

    The major issue is that Enron does not support traffic to many of our
    concentration point so we need to be creative.

    Bottom line, we are down to solvable problems with solution activities
    underway.

    * Windows 2000


    During the last week of May Compaq responded to a request from Enron to
    support Windows 2000 deployments, and placed people on site with no defined
    contract or process due to Enron's requirements.  At this writing, no
    contract has been signed, and the current contract iteration is at number
    fourteen.  Apparently the delivery scope has changed several times and there
    have been a few mistrals. Compaq is continuing to provide resources despite
    the fact that no contract is in place and will work with Enron to ensure a
    successful completion of the project.

    * Power Management

    Jesse Greene, our CFO, will act as the contact point for Enron for power
    management services. The issue is we have existing contracts at favorable
    rates but we will break the log jam.

    * HomePC Program

    For several months, Compaq and Enron have been working the solution to bring
    technology and Internet access into the homes of every Enron employee.
    There have been many creative discussions around hardware and financing to
    allow Enron to fully subsidize the package provided.  Compaq, Enron and
    Compaq Financial Services had gotten to a point where the $35 per month cap
    was going to require the specifications of the hardware to be reduced.  In
    recognition of the value of our partnership and our mutual desire for this
    program to be the premier program in the industry, we have increased the
    specifications of the hardware while taking significant pricing actions and
    financing rate reductions.  These actions will actually allow Enron to
    support better than expected hardware with the extended warranty for $34.28
    per month.   This will truly be an industry-leading program when launched
    later this fall.

    Dear Mr. Lay:

    Here is the new Service Provider version of our white paper as promised. I'd
    like to know what you think. Please forward to the appropriate members of
    your staff.

    We'd like to help in any way we can. We'd like to schedule a conference call
    with your staff at your earliest convenience to discuss your VPN needs.

    Sincerely,

    Dear Mr. Lay:

    Here's the newly completed Enterprise version of our white paper, and the
    Service Provider version is being finished now. I'll send that along as soon
    as it's ready.

    After you and your associates read it, I think you'll discover that we
    provide a VPN tool that eases provisioning of Nortel Contivity, Cisco IOS,
    Altiga and PIX, as well as VPN management and security policy auditing. This
    would compliment your existing solutions and greatly expand your ability to
    penetrate the market with your product offering.

    Let me know technical questions you come up with and I'll get our CTO to
    answer them for you.

    Dear Mr. Lay:

    Because you were recognized Business Week in 1999  for "taking Enron into
    the red-hot communications industry" by "developing an intelligent network
    platform to facilitate online business and building a market for trading
    bandwidth", we'd like to get your opinion on how we can contribute to your
    initiative.

    TBD Networks is a Secure VPN Management software company here in Silicon
    Valley. We believe Enron could benefit from using our highly scalable
    software to manage VPNs Enterprise-wide by:

    1) Speeding up the setup and provisioning time for tens of thousands of
    VPNs.
    2) Uniquely Vendor-Independent: Supporting all types of VPNs (Remote
    Access/Site-to-site/Extranet), based on equipment, products and technologies
    from Cisco IOS, PIX, Altiga, Nortel and Check Point.
    3) Reducing training and support needs by using our easy-to-use, web-based
    GUI based on high-level policies, hiding low-level, vendor-specific
    interfaces.
    4) Providing significantly higher levels of security and control VPNs via
    advanced features such as random policy auditing and proactive service
    monitoring.

    We would be very interested in meeting with someone at Enron to find out how
    you would like to proceed. Who would you suggest we contact?

    We would like to make a clarification wherein the words =01&Call Centres=01=

  text: "Ken, Jeff , Joe & Cliff,\n\nThis is a copy a note I sent to PR(Steve Kean
    & John Ambler), IR(Mark Koenig) \nand Enron India(Sanjay Bhatnagar & Jimmy Mogal)
    regarding our internal \nannouncement to  EGEP/EOGIL employees in Houston and
    India on October 13, \n2000.\n\n\nOn Friday (last night Houston time) we announced
    to employees Enron's \ndecision to sell Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. (EOGIL), our
    subsidiary that owns \na 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession
    areas.    We now have \nbankers involved and a data room is being prepared in
    Houston which  made it \nextremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.
    \ There were numerous \nrumors circulating through the office, but the reality
    of the announcement \nwas still a shock to most of the employees in India and
    Houston. Basically we \nsaid the following:\n 1) Selling assets or companies is
    a routine part of Enron's strategy to \nredeploy capital in the higher return
    opportunities.  The company has \nexposure to a number of tremendous opportunities
    today that were not \nenvisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy,
    we are \nplacing EOGIL in the market.\n 2) Depending on the success of finding
    an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we \nwill be reviewing the balance of our portfolio
    for transfer to other Enron \nentities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate
    closing the EOGIL \ntransaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March
    31, 2001.  \n 3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron
    Global \nE&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001.\n 4) We announced some
    interim staff changes to facilitate the process. \n  a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus
    his time largely on the sale process\n  b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for
    all India activity except the sale \nprocess\n  c) Steve Harper will be responsible
    for EGEP's sale activity and \ncoordination with our bankers and Corporate Development\n
    5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.  We told \nthem
    it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a \nPSA
    with a buyer.  However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many \npeople
    will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers \nor through
    redeployment within Enron.  Those people that do not remain with \nthe assets
    or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated \nMarch 31, 2001
    unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide \ntransition services
    to a buyer.\n \nI would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.  Last year
    when we were \nfor sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know.
    \ If anyone in \nthe media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early
    next week.  Mike \nStewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (01191228395841)
    and can \nbe reached at the Mariott after-hours(01191228577878).  He is fully
    briefed \non our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL.  Mike
    will be \ntraveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday.  I
    will be \navailable all weekend and next week at the following numbers; (work)
    \n713-853-5934, (home) 281-320-2198, (cell) 713-569-4713.  I would suggest \ntalking
    with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible.\n\nThis afternoon
    I notified our partners and the Gov't of India of our \nintention to market our
    assets.  I will be making a trip to India soon to \nvisit with the appropriate
    people in these organizations within the next two \nweeks.  While I wouldn't expect
    this to happen, please refer any inquiries \nfrom our partners (ONGC and Reliance)
    or the GOI to Mike or me.  As you might \nexpect, we want to be careful and consistent
    in our message to these \ngroups.   \n\nI will keep you informed regarding any

  subject: Congressman Sessions' Weekly Newsletter
  text: "From:  Pete\n\nTo:  Ken\n\nDate: Friday, October 13, 2000\n\n\nTHE HILL REPORT\nA
    Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions\nWeek of October 7 - October
    13, 2000\n\nThis Week in Washington, we witnessed a horrific tragedy in the Middle\nEast.
    This week's situation has escalated into a sad reminder of\nthe sacrifice our
    men and women in uniform make when they report\nto duty each day in service to
    our country. Our thoughts, prayers\nand support go out to their families and to
    all American military\nmen and women serving our nation all over the world.\n\nThis
    is also a reminder that though we are living in an era of relative\npeace and
    prosperity, America has enemies. There is unrest in the\nworld and we must be
    prepared to do everything in our power to find\nthe people responsible for this
    heinous act and bring them to justice\nswiftly. The world's brokers of terror
    will know there are consequences\nwhen America is the target of their hate. We
    are a peace and freedom\nloving people and these actions will not be tolerated
    against our\nsoldiers or our citizens.\n\nIn the United States House of Representatives
    we passed both the\nDefense Authorization Bill and the Agriculture Appropriations
    bill\nfor fiscal year 2001.\n\nThe Defense Authorization Act, (H.R. 4205) passed
    by a vote of 382-31\nand authorizes $309.9 billion in new budget authority for
    national\ndefense activities in FY 2001.  In honoring our commitment to our\nmen
    and women in service, this amount is $4.6 billion more than the\nClinton-Gore
    Administration's request.\n\nOverall, the conference report authorizes (1) $75.8
    billion for military\npersonnel; (2) $110.0 billion for operations and maintenance
    and\nworking capital funds, (3) $62.9 billion ($2.6 billion more than\nthe president's
    request) for weapons procurement, (4) $38.9 billion\n($1.1 billion more than the
    president's request) for research and\ndevelopment, (5) $8.8 billion ($788 million
    more than the president's\nrequest) for military construction and family housing.\n\nI
    strongly supported the measure and voted for it.  The bill also\nprovides a much
    needed and much deserved 3.7 percent military pay\nraise and numerous bonuses
    and other retention and quality of life\nprograms.\n\nThe Agricultural Appropriations
    bill that also passed this week will\nhelp farmers and producers of livestock
    and dairy who are suffering\nanother year of weather and financial losses, including
    an additional\nprovision that lifts limits to $150,000 this crop year on Loan
    Deficiency\nPayments (LDPs) and provides the first move to re-opening for agricultural\ntrade
    into Cuba.\n\nOn Thursday, by a vote of 340 to 75, the House approved H.R. 4461,\nthe
    Agricultural Appropriations Act, with the Senate expected to\nfollow within the
    week.\n\nProducers suffering a series of harvest losses due to weather extremes\nwill
    be able to draw upon funding that provides as much help as possible,\nby providing
    upwards of $1.6 billion for crops - beyond USDA's recent\n$1.3 billion estimate.\n\nA
    prescription drug importation measure was also included in the\nbill and will
    become law as part of the Agriculture Appropriations\nAct for Fiscal Year 2001.
    I hailed the measure as a victory for seniors.\n\nThis is great news for America's
    seniors.  I have always said that\nthe world's best consumers should not be paying
    the world's highest\nprices. This week we passed a bill to change that.\n\nCurrently,
    seniors in Texas and across the country are paying as\nmuch as 70% more for prescription
    drugs than their counterparts in\nother countries. For example, in 1998, a 30-day
    supply of \"Prilosec\"\ncost about $99.95 in Texas but that same 30-day supply
    was a mere\n$17.50 in Mexico.\n\nI strongly support giving seniors more choices
    in their health care\noptions but warned that increased choices means increased
    responsibility.\n Millions of seniors wanted to be able to buy prescription drugs\nfrom
    Canada and Mexico in order to save money on some drugs.  This\nbill does that
    for them but seniors must be aware of the safety concerns\nassociated with getting
    drugs from other countries.\n\nAround Texas...\n\nTomorrow, I will hold a town
    hall meeting in Mexia,  and following\nthe town hall meeting there will be a \"Cancer
    Society Walk for Life\".\n And next week, I will be in Bryan for a Town Hall Meeting.

    New York, NY  10021
    Tel:  (212) 628-3668



    October 13, 2000

    This past Wednesday eveing, the cocktail party in honor of the National
    Audubon Society=01,s Living Ocean, held at the home of W. Graham Arader III=
     at
    1016 Madison Avenue, was a stellar event, drawing a crowd and raising
    awareness.  The focus of the event was the launching of the =01&Just Ask=01=
    8
    campaign, aimed at protecting the creatures of the sea by expanding consume=
    r
    awareness about food from the ocean.  Attendees sampled delicious recipes
    from some of the top US chefs, all of whom used fish recommended by the
    =01&Seafood Lover=01,s Almanac,=018 a beautifully designed, whimsical guide=
     to fish
    and shellfish that serves to help consumers become more familiar with the
    seafood they eat.
    .
    Edited by Ms. Mercedes Lee (with Suzanne Iudicello and Dr. Safina
    contributing), the Seafood Lover=01,s Almanac provides readers with crucial
    information regarding sea life: what is safe to eat, for example, and which
    species are endangered.  Many seafoods commonly available today are much
    less plentiful than the average consumer might think.  Consumers hold the
    greatest influence over the buying decisions of seafood wholesalers and
    retailers, and with the efforts of the National Audubon Society this issue
    will have a much greater chance of receiving widespread attention.

    America=01,s top seafood chefs (and their spectacular creations) were in
    attendance, including Rick Moonen, of Oceana, New York; Todd English,
    Kingfish Hall, Boston; Jonathan Eismann, Pacific Time, Miami; Robert
    Kinkead, Kinkead=01,s, Washington, D.C.; and Terence Feury, Striped Bass,
    Philadelphia.  The sampling of food ranged from Margarita Oysters to
    Dungeness Crabcakes with Chipotle Vinaigrette, Sesame Seared Tuna with
    seaweed salad, pickled ginger, wasabe and fried wontons, all served up in a=
    n
    irresistible fashion.  Best of all, the chefs generously shared their
    recipes to all who whished to recreate these delicious appetizers at home.

    Other notable guests included Jennifer Bogo, Associate Editor for The
    Environment Magazine; Barbara Fairchild, Editor and Chief of Bon Appetite;
    Mindy Fox of the Earth Pledge Foundation; Jennifer Herman of Martha Stewart
    Magazine; Ray Isle, Senior Editor of Wine & Spirits; James Rodewald, Senior
    Editor of Gourmet; and of course, Graham Arader, a long time supporter of
    the Audubon Society, who would not have missed the event for the world.

    The evening was permeated by celebration and enthusiasm for the new =01&Jus=
    t
    Ask=018 campaign: a wonderful sign that support for the Audubon Society and=
     all
    of its fundamental projects continues to grow.  Please do not hesitate to

    Hi Kenneth,

    My name is Cole Albon.  I work for Sigaba, a secure internet communications
    company and I'd like to get you started using our technology.   We enable a
    "send secure" button in an existing email client so that your sensitive
    emails can be sent across the internet in privacy.  Sigaba is extremely easy
    to use and works on both internal and external company email.  I'd like you
    and your executive team to start using our software.  Then, if it makes
    sense for you to use our encryption solution on a company wide basis, I'd
    like to present you with an enterprise solution.

    Why?
    - When you send an email, it is sent through several servers on the way to
    its recipient.
    - These servers are not owned by you or the recipient, so many people can
    read the contents.
    - Given your position, you probably send information that you don't want
    others to read.
    - Sigaba can give you the technology to protect your emails without you
    changing your software or email habits.

    My contact information is below and you can download our software at
    http://www.sigaba.com.  If you'd like investigate further, please feel free
    to contact me directly or forward my contact information to your Manager of
    Network Security.

    Thanks for your time,

  text: "Ken, I have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the ARC Northern
    \nGas Pipeline Route.  Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain \nstrategic
    investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of \nthis proposal.
    \ To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory \npipe, ENA's opportunity
    lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis \nmarkets or customer transactions
    that provide attractive risk reward \ncharacteristics. Other than understanding
    the potential flows and costs, \nthere is probably not much we need to do today
    given a 2006 start from an ENA \npoint of view.\n\nThe ARC consortium needs to
    fund approximately $30M to develop this project.  \nThe US and Canadian aboriginal
    groups will receive 33% ownership for $10M.  \nthe remaining $20M and 67% will
    be funded by a group of producers, pipelines, \nventure capital and the \"organizing
    group\" (40%!!).  Stan Horton, if he \nbelieves this is a commercial possibility,
    may want to provide a few million \nof founding capital to the venture in order
    to preserve him the option to \nparticipate as an equity holder or operator if
    this becomes a reality.  \n\nRegards\nDelainey"

    \nPolitical Economy\" October 2000. To go directly to the web version, click on:\nhttp://www.csis.org/americas/pubs/weintraubnewsletters102000.html\n\nFor

    E. Simon Chair in Political Economy\nCenter for Strategic and International Studies\np-
    202-775-3123\nf- 202-466-4739\n\n\nISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY\nOctober
    2000, Number 10\n\n\nTELLING IT LIKE IT IS\nSidney Weintraub\n\nThis is my curmudgeon
    commentary. Its barbs are directed against \nexaggeration, double talk, and scapegoating
    of important institutions engaged \nin global economic development.\n\nI do not
    intend, in what follows, to disparage the importance of labor unions \nin protecting
    the rights and benefits of workers, or to argue that the United \nStates is a
    protectionist nation, or to doubt the valuable work that is done \nby multilateral
    institutions. My purpose, rather, is to highlight a few \npoints: the hypocrisy
    that exists when imports of goods and services from \npoor countries are restricted
    while simultaneously insisting that this \nexclusion will benefit workers in those
    countries; the inconsistency of \npromoting democracy in developing countries
    even as we neglect the interplay \nof foreign trade, economic well-being, and
    political outcomes; the \nperpetuation of the fiction that multilateral institutions
    are independent \nactors that behave supranationally in ways that conflict with
    the desires of \ntheir powerful members; and the misconception that institutions
    such as the \nWorld Bank provide a service by promising more than they can deliver.\n\nThe
    leaders of organized labor in the United States opposed NAFTA and the \ngrant
    of permanent normal trading relations with China. They are also against \na free
    trade area of the Americas and opening a new round of negotiations in \nthe World
    Trade Organization. The stated basis for this opposition is that \nthe United
    States should not further liberalize its import structure until \nother countries
    accept core labor standards (right of association, power to \norganize and bargain
    collectively, prohibition against forced labor, minimum \nage for employment of
    children, and acceptable working conditions), and that \npunishment should be
    meted out in the form of U.S. import restrictions when \nthese standards are violated.\n\nIs
    this protectionism or a socially conscious initiative to upgrade labor \nconditions
    in poor countries? The leaders of poor countries insist that they, \ntoo, want
    to raise labor standards, but cannot do this if their export \nearnings are restricted.
    The practical result of the U.S. position is that \nmeaningful trade negotiations
    are not going forward. Even though labor \nleaders insist this is not about protectionism,
    it sure looks like \nprotectionism. (Former senator Dale Bumpers has noted that
    when politicians \nsay something is not about money, it is about money.)\n\nWorld
    Bank analysis has shown persuasively that the developing countries that \nhave
    made the most progress in raising incomes are those that have opened \ntheir markets
    and engaged actively in world trade. However, there are still \nantitrade advocates
    who advise today's developing countries to look inward, \njust as many of today's
    developed countries focused first on internal markets \nand protecting their producers
    against foreign competitors. This was \nAlexander Hamilton's advice to the newborn
    United States. It was the \ndevelopment pattern for Japan. It was Ra?l Prebisch's
    advice to Latin \nAmerican countries. Although this advice may have had some relevance
    once \nupon a time for countries with large or potentially large internal markets,
    \nsuch as Brazil, it surely does not for countries with tiny markets, like many
    \nin Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa. The lesson of post-World War II
    \ndevelopment history is that countries that looked outward, such as those in
    \nEast Asia, grew rapidly, while those that looked inward, as in Latin America,
    \nwere relatively stagnant.\n\nIs the advice to poor countries to look inward
    in the modern and increasingly \nglobalizing world sincere, or is it designed
    to prevent competition in the \nU.S. market? Why advise developing countries to
    emulate the world's losers \nrather than the winners?\n\nA dominant aspect of
    U.S. foreign policy today is to promote democracy \nwherever this seems feasible,
    such as in Latin America and the Caribbean, \nEast Asia, Africa, and the transition
    nations of the former Soviet Union. \nThis is a laudable effort. At the same time,
    however, the most severe U.S. \ntrade restrictions are directed against imports
    from developing \ncountries-such as sugar and textile products from just about
    everywhere, \norange juice from Brazil, and steel from many developed and developing
    \ncountries alike. U.S. foreign aid now represents 0.1 percent of our gross \nnational
    product, placing it at the bottom of the list of donor countries. \nOur slogan
    used to be \"trade, not aid.\" Now it is more like \"not too much \ntrade and
    very little aid.\"\n\nIt is extremely difficult for poor countries to establish
    stable democracies. \nAchieving this obective is made even more complex by the
    inherent \ncontradiction in U.S. policy-preaching democracy even as we limit the
    ability \nof these countries to obtain the resources necessary to make democracy
    \npossible.\n\nDuring the past year much invective has been hurled at key multilateral
    \ninstitutions established at the end of World War II. This was evident in \nSeattle
    late last year when protesters tried to disrupt the meetings of the \nWorld Trade
    Organization (the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade, which
    came into being in 1947), and again last month in Prague \nduring the annual meetings
    of the World Bank and the International Monetary \nFund. It is not clear why the
    demonstrations were directed against these \ninstitutions rather than at the countries
    which determine the institutions' \npolicies. They are not supranational bodies,
    but rather creatures of their \nmasters, the world's most powerful national governments.\n\nIt
    is troubling when nongovernmental organizations exercise their right of \nfree
    speech by preventing delegates to international meetings from exercising \ntheir
    right of free speech. We should not be troubled, however, when serious \nnongovernmental
    observers act constructively to change practices they find \noffensive. The IMF
    has long been ultrasecretive about its analyses and \nfindings; this is inappropriate
    for an institution that obtains its funds \nfrom national governments (i.e., from
    taxpayers). The WTO's \ndispute-settlement procedures, which are an important
    part of that \norganization's work, have themselves been overly secretive. Many
    of these \npractices are changing, and the outside critics deserve much of the
    credit \nfor this greater openness.\n\nThe president of the World Bank, James
    Wolfensohn, has exerted great effort \nto make the bank's work more transparent.
    At the same time, he exaggerates, \nincorrigibly so. He implies that the bank,
    under his leadership, has \n\"discovered\" that economic growth, while necessary,
    is not sufficient to \nachieve widespread social development. There are many examples
    of this \nattitude. Only one will be cited: \"The old approach of an exclusive
    focus on \ngrowth as the elixir for all the world's problems is thus too circumscribed\"
    \n(op-ed by Wolfensohn and Joseph Stiglitz, Financial Times, September  22, \n1999).
    Wolfensohn's emphasis on alleviating poverty is praiseworthy, but the \ntrashing
    of all the foreign aid practitioners who preceded him for not \nunderstanding
    the multiple aspects of development is egregiously inaccurate \nand ungracious.\n\nThe
    World Bank's World Development Report 2000/2001 is devoted exclusively to \n\"attacking
    poverty.\" It approaches this theme citing three areas for action: \ncreating
    opportunities, empowering the poor, and providing greater security \nagainst the
    risks the poor face. The study contains a mountain of data and \nundoubtedly will
    be a valuable reference source for years to come. What it \nfails to do, however,
    is to explain how the World Bank can achieve these \ngoals, particularly empowerment,
    which it admits depends on \"the interaction \nof political, social, and other
    institutional processes.\" Is this the role of \nthe World Bank?\n\n\nIssues in
    International Political Economy is published by the William E. \nSimon Chair in
    Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies (CSIS),
    a private, tax-exempt institution focusing on \ninternational public policy issues.

    policy positions. Accordingly, all views, \npositions, and conclusions expressed

    \ \nMonday, October 16, 2000 8:43 AM\n\n\nIMPRESSIVE LETTER FROM LIZ CHENEY PERRY\n\n\n\nIn
    this America of  \nours, where the passion for publicity is a disease and\nwhere
    swarms of  \nfoolish tawdry moths dash with rapture into its consuming\nfire,
    it was a rare  \ngood fortune that brought to eminence a man so reserved,\nso
    unassuming, so  \nretiring, so gracious to high and low, and so serene.&quot;\nJudge
    Learned  \nHand in tribute to Justice Cardozo, 1938.\n\nHere are some things America
    \ \nshould know about my dad, Dick Cheney.? He\nloves the mountains and  \nrivers
    and prairies that stretch into forever in\nWyoming.? He is of the  \nAmerican
    West.? His handshake is firm.? He looks you\nin the  \neye.? His word is his bond.?
    He is a world class listener, and  \nwhen\nhe talks, it is always worth listening.?
    I have never known a wiser  \nman.\nTo my three daughters, he is &quot;Papa.&quot;?
    Watching him with  \nhis granddaughters\nis a great joy.?? My daughters are young
    and  \ntheir concerns are the concerns\nof little girls -- dolls and play-dough
    and  \nfirst friends.? He has infinite\ntime for them, as he always has for my
    \ \nsister and me.? He is never rushed,\nnever hurried.? He is supremely  \nkind,
    loving and patient - listening to\ntheir latest song from school,  \nreading bedtime
    stories, or teaching them how\nto fish (a lesson Cheneys learn  \nearly). \nHe
    grew up in Casper, Wyoming in the days when you could ride your  \nbike out\nof
    town and hunt rabbits on the prairie.? His dad, a World War  \nII veteran,\nwas
    a career civil servant with the Soil Conservation  \nService.? His mom\nworked
    as a secretary at Bustard's Funeral Home to  \nmake ends meet.? He\npitched for
    the local American Legion baseball  \nteam.? He owed much of his\nskill to my
    grandmother, who had played for  \nthe Syracuse, Nebraska\nBluebirds, a nationally-ranked
    girls' softball  \nteam.? She caught his pitches\nmany evenings on their front
    lawn at 505  \nTexas Place.\nHe was the first in his family to graduate from college.?
    \ \nHe built\npowerlines across Wyoming and Colorado to help pay his way.? He
    \ \ncarried a\nticket for six years in the International Brotherhood of Electrical
    \ \nWorkers.\n\nHe married his high school sweetheart, Lynne, in  \n1964.?? One
    look at the\ninscriptions they penned in each other's  \nhigh school yearbooks
    and you know\nthey were as deeply in love at 18 as they  \nare today.? He was
    the captain of\nthe football team and she was the  \nhomecoming queen.? Getting
    her elected was\nhis first political  \ncampaign.\nThere have been lots of other
    campaigns since then.? Despite  \nhis success,\nhe's not a typical politician.?
    He's not a  \nglad-hander.? He's not a\nfast-talker.? He's not slick.? He is  \nwho
    he is.? He is real and honest and\ntrue.? \nHe loves this  \ncountry.? He knows
    how blessed we all are to be Americans.?  \nHe\ntaught my sister and me that we
    owe everything we have to the brave men  \nand\nwomen who died so that we could
    be free.? When we were young, he  \ntook us to\nthe battlefields where the Civil
    War was fought.? He taught  \nus to love\nhistory and to revere this great nation.???
    \ \nServing as Secretary of Defense was the greatest honor of his life.? I  \nhave\nheard
    him say that this was because of the troops, the men and women of  \nthe\nU.S.
    military.? I went with him to Arlington National Cemetery the  \nday of\nthe memorial
    service for the servicemen and women who died in the  \nPersian\nGulf War.?? I
    stood next to him in the amphitheater with  \nthe families who\nhad lost sons
    and daughters, husbands and wives, watching as  \nthe military\njets flew overhead
    in the missing man formation.? It was  \nthe first time I\never saw tears in his
    eyes. \nThere are cynics today who  \nwould have us believe that no politician
    is a man\nof honor.? Maybe the  \nlast eight years have done this to us.? I hope
    not.\nThere are good  \npeople in American politics today; honorable and wise
    people,\npeople who keep  \ntheir word and inspire us to live lives of goodness

  subject: Enron European Commercial Real Estate Requirements
  text: |-
    Ken,

    After our conversation with Gerry Hines at the Aspen Hospital my wheels
    started spinning.  If you remember, you mentioned to Hines that you would
    have your people contact his in reference to Enron's real estate requirement
    in London.  Well, this eager (maybe too eager) real estate broker's juices
    started flowing (Papa Duncan would be surprised to know that something
    besides Wendy gets me going)!

    If you need some quality competition, I have formed a strategic alliance
    with Trammell Crow Savills (www.trammellcrowsavills.com) specifically to
    pursue Enron's real estate needs in London and elsewhere in Europe.
    Trammell Crow Savills was formed in May to create one of the largest and
    most experienced full service real estate firms covering Europe,
    Asia-Pacific and Australia.  I was able to form this alliance specifically
    to go after your business because 4 of the top officers at Trammell Crow are
    friends of mine.  Don Williams (Chairman), Pryor Blackwell  (COO), Chuck
    Anderson (Regional President) and Mike Lafitte (President Dallas and Blake
    Poston's Godfather).  In fact, Trammell Crow is hosting a golf tournament in
    October that will raise $70,000 for Rise Dallas!

    Mike Lafitte is the only one who knows that Enron is the potential prospect.
    So, if I have my nose where it does not belong I can shut it down without
    any fanfare.

    Could there be an opportunity to meet with Enron to sell Trammell Crow
    Savills for your London and/or European real estate needs?

    It's a long shot, I know.  But, I had to take a swing!

    Sincerely,

    John

    UTC Sales Call\n\nAt UTC's request, yesterday Mike Jackson and I met with Kent
    Brittan, VP, \nGlobal Sourcing, and members of his sourcing group.  As you remember,
    we \nfirst met Kent when Tom White, Dan Leff, Harold Buchanan and I called on
    him \ntwo years ago.  At the time, we presented an early version of a fully bundled
    \nenergy outsource in partnership with Fluor Daniel and a local real estate \nmanagement
    firm.\n\nOver the last two years, UTC attempted various energy procurement strategies,
    \nfailing to execute any.  \n\nBrittan was very pleased with the content of our
    revised proposal yesterday, \nand told us he would be taking the revised partnership
    strategy we discussed \ndirectly to George David, CEO.  \n\nBrittan will also
    be taking the preliminary concept to UTC Corporate \nTreasury, to gain its buy
    in on the financing aspects of the deal required to \nsupport the demand side
    management infrastructure investments it so \ndesperately needs to affect the
    energy  consumption reduction to which David \ncommitted two years ago.\n\nBarring
    a problem there, it appears we have finally engaged UTC in an \nexclusive negotiating
    relationship that would yield a large scale outsource \nof energy supply and demand
    side investment operations in all the UTC \ncompanies, excepting Carrier.    Carrier
    continues to insist it be treated \nseparately, and Brittan has decided to carve
    it out, rather than hold up the \nentire deal.  I think that strategy is part
    of what he will be speaking to \nDavid about.\n\nI requested, and Brittan agreed,
    that Karl Kropic (COO) be the executive \nsponsor.\n\nMike Jackson who has worked
    on and off with UTC over the past 18 months will \nbe the lead Originator for
    EES moving forward.\n"

    October 17, 2000

     In the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, Vice President Gore is=
    =20
    returning to the theme that Governor Bush=02=07s Texas has become an abysma=
    l place=20
    to live. It is a hard case to make=02=05Texas is today the fifth fastest gr=
    owing=20
    state and fifth in net influx of Americans from other states, and Mr. Bush =
    is=20
    one of the nation=02=07s most popular governors.
     Mr. Gore=02=07s earlier attacks on the governor=02=07s education record we=
    re set aside=20
    following the July release of a comprehensive RAND study showing that Texas=
    =20
    has become the nation=02=07s top state in achievement test scores. His subs=
    equent=20
    assertions about the number of Texans lacking health insurance seem to have=
    =20
    fizzled as well (it turns out that the number of uninsured has been falling=
    =20
    in Texas while rising in the nation as a whole). That leaves environmental=
    =20
    quality, where the Vice President and his ad writers have leveled a fusilla=
    de=20
    of dramatic allegations about increasing pollution in Texas=02=07s cities a=
    nd=20
    streams.
     Environmental quality presents rich opportunities for misleading data and=
    =20
    rhetoric. Measuring air and water pollution involves a host of variables: o=
    ne=20
    can measure pollution by emissions or by the quality of the air and water,=
    =20
    and measurements of air and water quality depend on the placement of=20
    monitors, the use of *peak* versus average levels, and adjustments for=20
    population exposure and for the widely differing health and amenity effects=
    =20
    of different kinds of pollution. Rankings among states are much more=20
    problematic than rankings of school performance or health care, because all=
    =20
    states that are more urbanized and industrialized have higher pollution=20
    levels. Texas accounts for 60 percent of the nation=02=07s petrochemical=20
    production capacity and 25 percent of oil refining, and it is the only stat=
    e=20
    with two metropolitan areas (Houston and Dallas-Ft. Worth) among the nation=
    =02=07s=20
    top ten. Measured by simple gross quantities, Texas, California, and New=20
    Jersey will have *more pollution* than most other states under any=20
    circumstances; the rest of us can enjoy the products without having to both=
    er=20
    so much with the pollution-control challenges.
     Mr. Gore=02=07s charges exploit these opportunities to the hilt, combining=
    =20
    misleading statistics with a few outright fabrications to create an=20
    impression that bears little relationship to reality. The charges are,=20
    however, easy to debunk, and it is surprising that they been reported with=
    =20
    little scrutiny by a media that has otherwise grown wary of the Vice=20
    President=02=07s loose ways with facts.
     The Gore campaign=02=07s favorite charge is that Houston has passed Los An=
    geles=20
    to become *the smog capital of the United States,* *No. 1 in air pollution,=
    *=20
    and *the dirtiest city in the nation.* (We will ignore Democratic National=
    =20
    Committee Chairman Joe Andrew=02=07s claim that Houston has become *the dir=
    tiest=20
    city in the world,* which was evidently uttered in a fit of enthusiasm for=
    =20
    the latest party line.) The charge is false. According to the U.S.=20
    Environmental Protection Agency, air quality in Houston is improving and is=
    =20
    unambiguously better than in Los Angeles, and is also better than in many=
    =20
    other cities.
     The Houston charge is based on 1999 city data on ambient levels of ozone=
    =02=05one=20
    of six *criteria* air pollutants regulated under the national Clean Air Act=
    =02=05
    as measured by numbers of days of *exceedences*of the EPA=02=07s national=
    =20
    standard. Ozone levels are highly sensitive to weather conditions, especial=
    ly=20
    temperature. They have been essentially flat in Houston in recent years (an=
    d=20
    other southern cities such as Atlanta), but they fell sharply in Los Angele=
    s=20
    in 1999 due to unusually cool summer weather. As a result, Houston topped L=
    os=20
    Angeles (and all other cities) in ozone exceedences=02=05but its air qualit=
    y was=20
    nevertheless better than LA=02=07s. Houston=02=07s ozone level was 10 perce=
    nt higher=20
    than in Los Angeles, but its particulates level was 20 percent lower=20
    (particulates are the other major component of *smog,* and according to the=
    =20
    EPA a far more serious health risk than ozone; there is no separate measure=
    =20
    of *smog*). Houston did vastly better than LA for three of the four other=
    =20
    Clean Air Act pollutants: 63% lower for nitrogen oxides, 64% lower for carb=
    on=20
    monoxide, and 78% lower for lead (the cities=02=07 sulphur dioxide levels w=
    ere=20
    identical). While Houston was out of compliance with EPA=02=07s national st=
    andard=20
    for only one pollutant, ozone, LA was out of compliance for three: ozone,=
    =20
    particulates, and carbon monoxide.
     We hasten to add that we are comparing Houston with Los Angeles only to=20
    demonstrate the falsity of Mr. Gore=02=07s allegation. If Houston is not nu=
    mber=20
    one in air pollution, neither is it number two or even number six (Houston =
    is=20
    the nation=02=07s sixth largest metropolitan area).  According to the EPA A=
    ir=20
    Quality Index, which aggregates levels of all six air pollutants and weight=
    s=20
    them according to the health risks of each, air quality in Houston is bette=
    r=20
    than in ten other metropolitan areas. Houston also bests ten other cities o=
    n=20
    a separate EPA index of ozone alone. (These data are for 1998, the most=20
    recent year available; rankings for 1999 and 2000 will probably be similar.=
    )
     A related charge, and particularly egregious falsehood, is Vice President=
    =20
    Gore=02=07s assertion that Governor Bush *made key air pollution rules in T=
    exas=20
    voluntary.* In 1999, Governor Bush signed two laws concerned with=20
    *grandfathered* sources of air pollution. Under the Clean Air Act and almos=
    t=20
    all state air pollution programs, old power plants and industrial facilitie=
    s=20
    are subject to much more lenient emissions standards than new ones. It is a=
    =20
    serious loophole that has been bad for the economy as well as the environme=
    nt=02=05
    inducing firms to maintain old facilities (both less efficient and more=20
    polluting than new ones) for longer then they otherwise would, and leading =
    to=20
    protracted litigation over the difference between renovating an old facilit=
    y=20
    and building a new one. Under the 1999 legislation, Texas became one of the=
    =20
    first three states to begin closing the loophole through tighter standards=
    =20
    for old facilities. The step was praised by environmental groups and helped=
    =20
    coax Mr. Gore, who had not previously confronted the problem as a legislato=
    r=20
    or Vice President, to propose a national program of his own for old power=
    =20
    plants. (Mr. Bush has also advanced a national proposal.)
     But there was a wrinkle in the Texas initiative: the law covering utilitie=
    s=20
    enacted mandatory standards (which will result in huge reductions in power=
    =20
    plant emissions over the next three years), but the law covering industrial=
    =20
    facilities enacted a *voluntary* compliance schedule coupled with increased=
    =20
    fees for noncompliance. There is legitimate disagreement over just how=20
    effective the fee-incentive program will turn out to be; there have been so=
    me=20
    initial reductions in the first year, apparently of about 25,000 tons of ai=
    r=20
    pollution, but the program is too recent to estimate likely future=20
    reductions. What is not in dispute is that both the *mandatory* and=20
    *voluntary* prongs of the Texas program constitute an extension and=20
    tightening of air pollution controls=02=05and an innovation that powerful b=
    usiness=20
    opposition has thwarted at the national level and in most states. Nor is it=
    =20
    disputed that the use of economic incentives rather than regulatory mandate=
    s=20
    may significantly improve the effectiveness of our environmental laws and a=
    re=20
    worth a try; indeed, that is precisely the approach of the Vice President=
    =02=07s=20
    national proposal for old utilities, which consists not of mandatory=20
    standards but *voluntary* tax incentives.
     For Mr. Gore=02=05a self-described environmentalist and reformer=02=05now =
    to turn on=20
    the Texas reforms and describe them as having weakened existing pollution=
    =20
    standards (*Bush made key air pollution rules voluntary*) is an act of=20
    striking mendacity. His latest campaign ad adds a particularly ruthless=20
    twist: it couples the *made voluntary* fabrication with the Houston air=20
    quality fabrication to produce a triple falsehood=02=05that air pollution g=
    ot=20
    worse in Houston because Governor Bush weakened air pollution standards.
     The Vice President=02=07s most plenary change is that, under Governor Bush=
    , Texas=20
    has become *last among all states in air quality,* *No. 1 in industrial air=
    =20
    pollution,* and *No. 3 in water pollution.* Although the Gore campaign has=
    =20
    occasionally relied on newspaper articles and rankings produced by=20
    environmental groups, its primary and only official source for these claims=
    =20
    is an EPA compilation called the Toxics Release Inventory. The TRI, however=
    ,=20
    is not a useful measure of air or water pollution and is not a measure of=
    =20
    environmental quality at all. Instead, it measures *releases* of certain=20
    substances that the EPA classifies as toxic=02=05and *releases* includes no=
    t only=20
    those that pollute the air and water but also those that are properly=20
    disposed of through EPA-approved hazardous waste management and water=20
    treatment practices. The agency=02=07s annual TRI reports warn that its est=
    imates=20
    *reflect releases and other waste management activities of chemicals, not=
    =20
    exposures of the public to those chemicals,* and that they are not sufficie=
    nt=20
    to determine exposure or harm to the environment or public health.
     So the TRI numbers cannot possibly support Mr. Gore=02=07s assertions. But=
     even=20
    in their own terms, they tell a story that is the opposite of what the Vice=
    =20
    President would like voters to believe. Texas has always been near the top =
    of=20
    the various TRI ratings, reflecting the state=02=07s huge share of national=
    =20
    petrochemical and refining capacity. But it did not become No. 1 in the=20
    overall ranking under Governor Bush, as the Gore campaign insinuates. Rathe=
    r,=20
    Texas was No. 1 under Mr. Bush=02=07s predecessor, Democratic Governor Ann=
    =20
    Richards, and it has improved significantly since he took office. The EPA=
    =02=07s=20
    1999 release of TRI data through 1997 noted that *Texas, the state with the=
    =20
    largest production-related waste managed in 1997, was also the state=20
    projecting the largest absolute reduction . . . over the next two years.* T=
    he=20
    data for 1998, released earlier this year, shows Texas leading the nation i=
    n=20
    reduction of toxic releases=02=05with 43 million pounds eliminated between =
    1995=20
    (the first year of Mr. Bush=02=07s governorship) and 1998. The new report a=
    lso=20
    finds Texas leading all other states in energy recovery and waste treatment=
    ,=20
    and second in on-site recycling. Due in part to these improvements, Texas h=
    as=20
    now dropped from first to fifth place in the TRI composite index.
     Environmental quality in Texas has improved under Governor Bush according =
    to=20
    virtually every useful measure. Here are a few selected statistics of our=
    =20
    own: According to the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission,=20
    industrial air emissions in Texas fell 11% from 1994 through 1998. Accordin=
    g=20
    to the EPA, ambient air quality in Texas improved for five of the six=20
    national air pollutants for the same period, all Texas cities but one now=
    =20
    meet the national standards for four or more of the six pollutants (the=20
    exception, El Paso, due to cross-border pollution from Mexico), and half of=
    =20

    ts.=20
    According to the EPA, Texas=02=07s proportion of rivers and streams classif=

    I just talked with Pinkney to assure that he was feeling well.  As you know,
    he was pretty well worn out by Saturday.  I think it was prudent of him to
    forgo the football game and rest instead.

    Anyhow, he is feeling quite well -- he sounded great.  He said he was still
    overwhelmed by the honor bestowed on him.  He, like I, was so very grateful
    of Ken's traveling to Columbia to be part of the presentation.  And, of
    course, he very much appreciated the first-class travel that Ken arranged
    for him on an Enron aircraft.

    He concluded by saying he's always be a Tiger!

  text: |+
    In light of Judge Stephen Gallagher's opinion on the City's homeless camping
    ordinance, Commissioner Sten and I have developed a comprehensive approach
    to dealing with homeless issues that includes working with private
    organizations.  Details follow below.

    I have also included an item requesting applicants for the Public Utilities
    Review Board.  This is a board I created with former City Commissioner Mike
    Lindberg in 1993 to provide needed citizen oversight of municipal utilities.
    I encourage people to consider becoming a part of this important board.

    You are a part of my e-Katz list because of your work with me or my
    administration.  To be removed from the "e-Katz" distribution list, simply
    reply to this e-mail with your request.  If you have multiple e-mail
    addresses you use, please include a name and/or company, otherwise we may

    MAYOR VERA KATZ, COMMISSIONER ERIK STEN PRESENT HOLISTIC APPROACH TO
    ADDRESSING HOMELESS ISSUES
    Reaffirming their commitment to providing safe, affordable housing while
    standing firm against homeless camping in the City of Portland, Mayor Vera
    Katz and Commissioner Erik Sten held a news conference today to announce
    their holistic approach to address homeless and housing issues.   The two
    focused on the City's ongoing efforts to preserve and create more affordable
    housing, the current tools available to continue enforcing anti-camping
    laws, and announced an expanded partnership with JOIN -- a private
    organization that does outreach to homeless people.

    "While I am still a firm believer in the need for the anti-camping ordinance
    to prevent unsafe and unsanitary campgrounds, this has given us the
    opportunity to take a closer look at what we in the City are doing to
    provide housing and shelter opportunities for everyone," said Katz, "and
    while we've made strides meeting our affordable housing commitments, there
    is still more we can do."

    Katz and Commissioner Erik Sten announced their intent to follow the
    recommendation of Sten's 0-30% Housing Resources Task Force to spend $3.5
    million of the $5 million allocated for affordable housing this coming year
    on housing for those in the 0-30 percent median income range.  Over the last
    seven years, the City of Portland has committed nearly $270 million towards
    affordable housing, in addition to foregoing $10.5 million in revenue
    through tax abatements.

    "Homelessness is an issue that should be addressed by first dealing with the
    individual at a personal level," said Commissioner Sten.  "I appreciate that
    the City is continuing to move forward on doing this with aggressive efforts
    around things such as housing and outreach services."

    Katz and Sten also noted recent successes in meeting affordable housing
    needs, including the Portland Development Commission's just-completed
    purchase of the Fountain Place apartment building and the recent opening of
    Ritzdorf Court which completed the Shelter Reconfiguration Plan.  The
    Fountain Place acquisition -- completed just last Friday, means the city
    will save the building's affordable housing rates, and serve as potential
    replacement housing for nearby low-income units soon to be lost.

    Additionally, Katz and Sten also announced an expanded partnership with JOIN
    -- an outreach group that works to connect the homeless with services.

    The Bureau of Housing and Community Development plans to increase JOIN's
    current contract with the bureau to a total of $90,000.  This money,
    combined with a new $80,000 contribution from the Portland Police Bureau,
    will increase the number of JOIN outreach workers, enabling them to work in
    every precinct to link homeless people with housing assistance resources.

    "It is critical that we find ways for all of us to work together to help
    homeless people find their way off the streets -- that means our outreach
    workers, police, ODOT, and neighbors all collaborating to make that happen,"
    said Rob Justus, Executive Director, JOIN.  "Our ultimate goal is to respond
    to homelessness and address the negative effect of hundreds on the streets
    by helping people into housing.  By engaging the homeless people where they
    are -- whether it's under a bridge or in an alleyway -- our outreach workers
    can help them begin that transition off the streets."

    At the same time, Katz and Sten said that the City's aggressive efforts to
    preserve and create affordable housing opportunities and to link homeless
    individuals to those opportunities, made it all the more reasonable to
    continue to enforce the City's anti-camping policy which prevents unsafe and
    unhealthy campsites from degrading neighborhood livability.  Both said they
    are pleased the Multnomah County District Attorney has decided to appeal
    Judge Stephen Gallagher's opinion that the City's Homeless Camping Ordinance
    is unconstitutional.

    While the City Attorney's Office and DA's Office continue to analyze the
    implications of the Gallagher opinion, Portland Police Bureau Assistant
    Chief Bruce Prunk outlined alternative tools the City intends to use to
    continue its efforts to restrict homeless camping in public areas.

    1. Parks -- City Code closes most City parks between midnight and 5
    a.m., others, such as Forest Park, close earlier.  After closure, people
    camping would be subject to state law prohibition on criminal trespass in
    the second degree, and police could issue citations and/or remove people for
    trespassing.  The City also has the ability to exclude people from City
    parks for a period of not more than 30 days.  Permanent or temporary
    structures or facilities are also prohibited by City Code at all times, so
    police could issue citations or remove people violating the ordinance as an
    unclassified misdemeanor.

    2. Highway Overpasses -- Oregon Department of Transportation property
    under I-5 and I-405 overpasses are posted with "No Trespassing" signs, which
    means police could issue citations to anyone camping at those locations.

    3. Sidewalks -- There are provisions of the City Code that prohibit
    sidewalk obstructions.

    4. Parking -- City Code prohibits parking a recreational vehicle in the
    public right of way directly across from a residential, public park, church
    or school property unless the vehicle is being loaded and unloaded for a
    period not to exceed eight hours.  In addition, no vehicle may park on the
    public right of way or other public property in excess of 24 hours without
    City permission.  If so, the vehicle may be removed.

    Prunk said the Police Bureau would continue to work with the partners
    currently in place, such as JOIN, noting that recent efforts have focused
    less on anti-camping citations, and more on trespassing violations.

    Institute's current research publications, events and media programs.

    3. Medicare Reform: Economics versus Politics

    -------------------------------------------------------------

    DEFECTIVE TIRES, DEFECTIVE BUREAUCRACY

    Some fans of the regulatory state believe that NHTSA, the National
    Highway Traffic Safety Administration, deserves much credit -- and,
    in reward, expanded powers -- for its role in exposing the Firestone
    tire/ Ford Explorer fiasco. But although NHTSA received early reports
    of fatalities caused by the separation of Firestone tires, its
    investigation began very recently -- last May -- long after
    investigations by State Farm Insurance, the Center for Auto Safety,
    and Safety Forum brought the problem to light.

    This isn't the first time that NHTSA has failed its mission, argues
    Michael I. Krauss, law professor at George Mason University and
    author of the recent Independent Institute book FIRE AND SMOKE:
    Government, Lawsuits and the Rule of Law.

    "NHTSA, the agency responsible for minimum fuel economy standards
    (found by a court to have likely cost many lives by forcing
    manufacturers to produce light, dangerous cars) and for
    illegal-to-disable, baby-killing airbags, does not deserve to be
    rewarded for its asleep-at-the-switch approach to the tire problem,"
    Krauss wrote recently.

    It would be absurd to reward Firestone for selling defective tires.
    However, when NHTSA fails, self-proclaimed "consumer advocates" call
    for a parallel absurdity: lavishing the agency with more regulatory
    authority and taxpayer funds. But NHTSA's pattern of failure
    indicates a systemic problem -- a design flaw -- that cannot be
    easily repaired. In contrast, as the Firestone episode demonstrates,
    the watchful eyes of the American economic and legal systems have
    enormous incentives to detect and report product defects. In this
    light, perhaps what most needs to be recalled and held accountable
    for sloppy workmanship and false advertising is: the defective
    regulatory state.

    PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS ON THE WAR ON CRIME

    Election-year promises always renew the risk that peaceful Americans
    will see their rights sacrificed for the sake of political
    expediency. This is especially true when politicians promise to "get
    tough on crime," as syndicated columnist and Independent Institute
    research fellow Paul Craig Roberts pointed out recently.

    Although one "anti-crime" bill (or "anti-privacy" according to its
    critics) was recently defeated, another "anti-crime" bill -- this one
    strengthening asset forfeiture laws -- has just been introduced.
    Unfortunately, says Roberts, asset forfeiture laws violate due
    process and are any easy way for politicians to look "tough on crime"
    even though such laws harm innocent Americans far more than criminals.

    "The House Judiciary Committee led by Henry Hyde, R-Ill., has
    documented the most extraordinary abuses of the asset forfeiture
    laws," writes Roberts. "The Banking Committee and [the bill's author]
    should sit down with Hyde and listen carefully before they create any
    more Gestapo powers for law-enforcement officers."

    Craig Roberts, at

    -------------------------------------------------------------

    MEDICARE REFORM: Economics versus Politics

    Debates over Medicare reform didn't start with Al Gore and George W.
    Bush. In fact, legislation similar to Medicare had been intensely
    debated since the mid-1940s. However, its advocates found no way to
    overcome opposition until 1965, when Medicare's staunchest advocate
    on the House Ways and Means Committee found the opportunity to
    smuggle Medicare legislation into another bill at the last minute.

    Yet as vocal as debates over Medicare have been, very little of that
    debate has been informed by sound economic principles. This omission,
    which has stalled any genuine reform of Medicare, is largely the
    fault of economists, says economist Robert B. Helms in the new issue
    of THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW.

    "My criticism is not directed to the economists who have attempted
    for many years to apply market principles to health-care issues, but
    to the larger number of economists who have not," Helms writes.
    "Moreover, my criticism pertains to the failure of economists to
    teach the fundamental principles of economics to educated Americans,
    rather than to the failure of 'economics.'"

    To improve the quality of the debate over Medicare, Helms recommends
    three measures. First, more economists must explain to policymakers
    and the public that that market competition in health care, as in
    other markets, would improve quality of health care. Second, they
    must explain that competition would also make health care more
    efficient by allocating scarce resources to higher-valued uses.
    Finally, they must explain that price controls and destructive of
    these desirable ends.

    Without a concerted effort to impart these principles to a wider
    audience, Helms argues, Medicare reform -- and other necessary
    health-policy reforms -- will become victim of political maneuvering,
    much to the detriment of the lives and well-being of the American
    public.

    "This lack of education in economics is appallingly evident in
    Washington, D.C., especially on Capitol Hill," says Helms.

    Atlantic Copper.  Our team met with the senior management from \nAtlantic Copper
    last week in concert with the London Metal Exchange Week.\n\nThere are several
    hurdles to overcome in structuring a deal to acquire \nAtlantic Copper and a long
    term copper concentrates supply from FM's \nIndonesian mine complex.   Current
    contract prices for copper smelting and \nrefining capacity are low and they might
    be a bit unrealistic on price.    We \nsuggested a conceptual structure that may
    work but is \nprobably a long shot at this time.   They were interested and requested

    I am one of Annat Jain=01,s girlfriends.  I need to bring some stark facts =
    to
    your attention.  Annat Jain, a senior director of communications at Enron
    India, boldly and shamelessly continues to set an example of =01&Ethical
    misconduct=018 and is risking the integrity of your organization in India a=
    s a
    whole.  This has been going on for the last 18 months!  While staying on
    Enron=01,s payroll, he boldly demonstrates conflict of interest by spending
    most of his time at his other private ventures (RazorFinish.com and
    Powervertical.com).

    Since apparently he enjoys the CEO=01,s friendship, he feels that he can wa=
    lk
    over anyone at anytime.  He is very abusive right from the office boy to th=
    e
    senior staff and openly boasts about his arrogance and attitude.  Respect
    towards others does not even cross his arrogant and rude self.  If one
    audits the last 18 months of credit card charges, purchases and other
    expenses, most of these charges are being made for his 2 private ventures
    (RazorFinish.com and Powervertical.com) or personal entertainment.

    To go totally overboard with his bold denial of ethics and company
    standards, he is now in the process of hiring and acquiring some individual=
    s
    from his 2nd venture (Powervertical.com) into Enron!  He also boasts openly
    that Enron India will soon acquire his company Powervertical.com so he can
    gain financially from such a transaction.  Thus, he continues to use Enron
    as a platform for his personal gains.  It is indeed a shame that such an
    individual represents your organization in the marketplace and industry.  A
    lot of the industry experts are aware of Annat=01,s unethical behavior and =
    his
    rude attitude in general dealings and have refused to work with Enron as
    such.  What example will he set for the organization as a whole and how lon=
    g
    will you tolerate such behavior?

    \nanalyze and develop an Alaskan Natural Gas Pipeline Project (tentatively \nnamed
    North Star Pipeline).  Both parties did not want to press release the \nMOU.\n\nThe
    MOU only commits us to jointly study, evaluate and fund a project \nproposal.
    \ It can be canceled at any time, for any reason, and is not an \nexclusive.\n\nThe
    \"Alaskan Producers\" are telling us they want to team-up with someone who \ncan
    help them get the gas to the markets.  Four (4) Bcf of incremental \nsupplies
    just cannot be directed to a market hub...i.e., Chicago, for \ninstance.\n\nOur
    goal with El Paso is to develop a joint market assessment of where the \ndemand
    for incremental supplies is needed and then develop a total project \nthat would
    get the gas to the various markets.\n\nOur ownership of NNG, TW and NBPL and El
    Paso's ownership of ANR, El Paso and \nTennessee will cover a lot of impacted

    in all regions and this report highlights a number of great\nsuccesses. Clearly
    we have had supply challenges so non-linear quarter\nagain, as you well know.
    \ We shall be working September hard!\n\nRegards\nPeter\n\n\n\n[Compaq Confidential
    - Internal Use Only]\n\nWorldwide Sales & Services team:\n\nMy travel report this
    month spans the Americas - from our operations in\nLatin America to those in Canada.
    \ I had many opportunities to visit with\nour sales and services employees as
    well as customers, partners, press and\nanalysts.  It's really great to have a
    role that brings me into regular\ncontact with employees and our external audiences
    - it's very exciting to\nsee how the momentum is building around the Corporation.\n\nLatin
    America has been very successful in its direct and partner\ninitiatives, particularly
    in Argentina, where we are now 55% direct, and\nBrazil which has 60% direct business.
    \ Our LA e-Business Development team is\nmaking tremendous strides to strategically
    position our business in the fast\ngrowing Internet space, while opening up new
    and exciting revenue streams.\nIn just four months of existence, the team has
    completed several new\nalliances with companies investing in the huge growth potential
    of the\nInternet in the region.  Key alliances in this exciting new \"ecosystem\"\ninclude:\n\nDiveo,
    a provider of integrated hosting and security services, secures\nCompaq's position
    as preferred vendor for this potentially huge customer.\nIt also allows us to
    offer critical enabling services that will accelerate\nthe adoption of the Internet
    and many valuable services in the region.\n\nWe entered a strategic alliance agreement
    with Artikos, a joint venture\nbetween Commerce One and Banamex, the largest bank
    in Mexico.  The terms of\nthe alliance permit Compaq to sell the Commerce One
    solution to the many\noff-line and on-line companies investing in B2B marketplaces.
    \ It also\npositions us to participate as strategic partners in new marketplaces
    being\nformed by established brick-and-mortar players.\n\nOur strategic alliance
    with Terra, a leading regional portal, has begun to\ngenerate exciting new revenue
    streams stemming from a customer\nacquisition/traffic arrangement using our Presario
    keyboard buttons.  In\njust four months of operation, we successfully sent 12
    million visitors to\nthe Terra portal and gained from traffic and revenue sharing
    arrangements\nthat form part of the alliance.\n\nPatagon.com - Our first Internet
    alliance, at a time when few, if any,\ncompanies recognized the Internet's potential
    in Latin America, continues to\npay important dividends.  Patagon.com has grown
    to become the leading\nfinancial portal in LA with the help of Compaq technology.
    \ We also are\nhelping sustain Patagon's growth in the market through a revenue
    generating\ntraffic alliance that links our customers to Patagon's portal through
    our\neasy access keyboard buttons.\n\nIn the coming months, you will surely be
    hearing more about these and other\nnew alliances that are transforming Compaq
    into a leading e-business in the\nregion.\n\nCanadian highlights\nMy trip north
    yielded not only relief from the Texas heat, but also many\nother great examples
    of progress that contributed to our Q2 results.  As you\nprobably know, David
    Booth, a 13-year veteran with Compaq and Digital, was\nnamed President and Managing
    Director of our Canada operations in May.  In\nQ2, the region increased their
    profits by 88% over Q299 and helped return\nCPCG to profitability.  Earlier this
    year, Compaq Canada launched eStore\noperations, and with other direct enhancements,
    expects to be 85% direct by\nthe end of this year.  Their Consumer Call Centre
    is racking up awards too -\nboth as Compaq Call Center of the Year, and from Call
    Center Magazine as the\nHigh Technology Call Center of the Year.  Product awards
    in Canada include:\n - ProLiant server received Computer Dealer News' 2000 Reseller\nChoice
    Award\n - Deskpro PC received ChannelLine Magazine's 2000 ChannelLine\nChamps
    Award\n - Aero/iPAQ Pocket PCs became the first monitoring devices for\ndiabetes
    in the world through Charles H. Best Diabetes Centre\n\nAnd last, but certainly
    not least, some great wins:  Banque Nationale, $2.1M\nfor Himalaya systems and
    services; Province of New Brunswick, $2M for MS\nExchange; Capital Health Region,
    $2M Deskpro/Armada PCs; Lotto Quebec, $1.5M\nfor Himalaya systems; CanJet, $1.5M

    $800K ProLiant servers; University of\nToronto, $790K Alpha Cluster; SaskTel,
    $700K Deskpro PCs; and Atlantic\nHealth Science Centre,  $500K AlphaServer systems\n.\n\nWorld's
    fastest and most powerful supercomputer\nToday we are announcing that the U.S.
    Department of Energy's National\nNuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has selected
    Compaq to build the\nworld's fastest and most powerful supercomputer, a 30+ TeraOPS
    system\ncode-named \"Q.\"  The contract is valued at more than $200M, and the\nsupercomputer
    will be housed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los\nAlamos, New Mexico.
    \ The supercomputer will support NNSA's integrated\nprogram of surveillance, experiments,
    non-nuclear tests, archived data,\nmodeling and simulation to assess and certify
    the safety, security and\nreliability of nuclear weapons without underground nuclear
    testing.\n\nThe supercomputer will consist initially of some 375 AlphaServer GS320\nsystems
    (approximately 12,000 Alpha processors) with EV68 CPUs running in\nexcess of 1,250
    MHz on our Tru64UNIX operating system.  Almost the size of\nfive basketball courts
    (more than 21,000 square feet), the system will have\nmore than 600 terabytes
    of Compaq StorageWorks storage, and receive onsite\n24x7 service and support.
    \ This major win, plus other recent wins (see\nNational Science Foundation below)
    are expected to establish Compaq as the\nNo. 1 provider in the high performance
    technical systems and servers\nmarketplace before the end of this year.  A great

    and the Compaq/Microsoft Channel. The\nseries, presented by a top IDC analyst,
    emphasized the tremendous market\nopportunity within the ASP market. Based on
    the overwhelming participation\nand positive feedback, there is a strong interest
    in learning more about the\nASP market. The second in the series will be presented
    September 7. To\nregister, call 800-289-0579 (outside US 719-457-2550).\n\nCoconut.com,
    an ASP in the UK initially offering mail and messaging, has\nnamed Compaq its
    key partner.  The solution, heavily leveraged around our\nProfessional Services
    capability, is Alpha and StorageWorks running\nSoftware.com's suite of carrier-grade
    mail and messaging products.  The\ninfrastructure will be managed by eBMS.  HP
    had been working on this for 18\nmonths, and Compaq got engaged the day before
    they were about to sign the\ndeal.  Seven weeks later HP was told they had lost
    the opportunity.  The key\nto our success was a partnering approach to help them
    with their business,\nnot just to sell them tin.  The near-term opportunity is
    $5M, with up to\n$25M over 5 years.  Congratulations to the UK team!\n\nGreat
    Compaq Financial Services deals\nSupply Access - CFS is providing a $6.5M financing
    facility on Alpha and NT\nservers for this service provider, owned by En Point,
    one of Compaq's\nlargest resellers in California.  The deal, which displaced HP
    and HP\nFinance, includes a two-year exclusivity agreement.\n\nAvantel - CFS also
    completed a $3.5M deal to refresh the installed base of\nAvantel's existing Compaq
    desktops and servers in Mexico.  While Avantel is\na longtime Compaq customer,
    the inclusion of Compaq Financial Services\nenabled a complex sale and lease back
    arrangement for the acquisition of\nCompaq equipment, with opportunities for ongoing
    contact with the customer.\n\nRoundup of Storage news\nAs you may have noticed
    from the earnings news, the Storage Product Group\nhad a strong Q2, with profitability
    of $179M, up 45% from last year.  SPG\ndelivered 11.8% of Compaq's net sales,
    17.8% of total gross margin, and a\nwhopping 31.6 % of Compaq's operating income.
    Other news from the Storage\nfront includes:\n * A SANworks print ad campaign,
    directed at corporate CIOs,\nstarted on July 10th and will be running for several
    weeks. The ads direct\ncustomers to a Web companion page for more information,
    go to\n<http://www.compaq.com/sanworks>.\n * On August 22, Compaq will open a
    new Enterprise Storage\nCustomer Center (ESCC) in Colorado Springs, Colo., that
    will develop and\nqualify advanced network storage technologies for complex enterprise\nenvironments
    and offer training for IT professionals. The Center will\ncomplement the new Storage
    Networking Technology Center that was announced\nearlier this spring by the Storage
    Networking Industry Association (SNIA)\nand is currently being constructed by
    Compaq.  Both centers will be housed\nunder one roof when the SNIA center opens
    later this year.\n * The Storage Networks Solutions Business Unit, focused on\nproviding
    leading-edge solutions to the industry, has created a Business\nDevelopment Team.
    For more information, contact Frank Orlando, who leads the\nteam.\n\nZero Latency
    and other BCSG attention-getters\nWhat debuted 10 months ago at Telecom99 as a
    riveting demonstration of\nCompaq's first Zero Latency Enterprise (ZLE) technology
    has matured into a\nformal go-to-market program that will be launched and rolled
    out in October.\nIts goal?  To help you identify ZLE opportunities and win deals.
    \ The\nBusiness Critical Server Group (BCSG) has established the ZLE Initiative
    to\nencompass all of our enterprise offerings - Himalaya; AlphaServer with Tru64\nUnix
    and OpenVMS; and ProLiant with Windows NT, as well as storage, clients\nand services.
    \ It will differentiate Compaq in the marketplace, generate\nmomentum for the
    company, and give us \"first-to-market\" status.  No other\ncompetitor can come
    close to what we offer.  The typical ZLE deal profile is\nhigh-revenue - $15M
    per deal - and high-margin, so the payoff is great.\nStay tuned for announcements
    in October, including info on ZLE customers;\ncool new offerings incorporating
    platforms, partners and services; new\ndemos; go-to-market tools to help you tell
    the ZLE story; ZLE expertise to\nassist with your accounts; and press and analyst
    proof points to help you\nsell.  I encourage you to learn more about ZLE so you
    can leverage its\nrevenue potential.  For more information, contact your BCSG
    region drivers.\n\nOther highlights from BCSG:\n * Congratulations to the Tandem
    BU for its Q2 performance, the\nsecond highest in revenue for the BU in Compaq
    history.  In addition, the\nS74 series had the fastest ramp in the history of
    the Himalaya platform,\nwith $69M in S74000 processors shipped since its May launch.\n
    * MUZO, a Czech payment authorization agency and long-time\ncustomer, will migrate
    to the most powerful of the Himalaya servers, the\nS74000, for its new authorization
    center opening in 1Q01.  MUZO provides\nATM/POS authorization and back-office
    services using Base24 from partner\nACI.  The order is important for Compaq in
    the Czech Republic because it\npositions the platform firmly in the country and
    demonstrates the success of\nthe ongoing efforts of the Czech subsidiary to build
    local Himalaya\nresources and skills.\n * The \"Dream Machine\" roadshow, which
    showcases the\nAlphaServer GS160 server running OpenVMS Galaxy, is starting its
    North\nAmerican tour. One of its first stops was in Boston in late July, where
    it\nreceived an enthusiastic response from the Compaq Board of Directors.\n *
    Recently named a partner for Oracle's iHost applications\nhosting initiative,
    Nupremis is the first service provider to announce that\nit will host Oracle iHost
    applications on AlphaServers running Tru64 UNIX in\nits data centers to provide
    the most scalable and highly available platform\nfor e-business.\n\nGreat things
    happening in the Consumer world\n* In 1Q, Compaq surpassed Packard Bell as the
    US installed base market\nshare leader for the first time, according to Media
    Metrix.  The number of\nCompaq PCs in US homes has increased 260% to 5.4 million
    from 1997 through\n1Q.\n* Presario portable PCs maintained their No. 1 U.S. retail
    sales share\nin June for the 22nd consecutive month, according to NPD Intelect\n*
    The Presario 1200XL-110 was rated a Best Buy and No. 1 Budget\nnotebook by PC
    World magazine\n* The Presario 1800T was rated the No. 5 Power notebook by PC
    World\nmagazine\n* Compaq's 2Q consumer PC sales in Malaysia were up over 1,200%,
    due\nlargely to Compaq's kiosk strategy there.  The kiosks have been successful\nenough
    to be featured in the Far East Economic Review\n* Compaq beat out four other PC
    manufacturers to partner with\nspecialty retailer Eddie Bauer on special edition
    Presario 1400 series\nportable PCs\n\nJoint news from Consumer and CPCG\nBy now
    I'm sure you've read about the exciting new additions to the iPAQ\nfamily of products
    and services, announced jointly by Mike Larson and Mike\nWinkler in New York on
    August 15.  The announcement symbolizes the growing\nconvergence of the commercial
    and consumer markets, and the mutual desire\nfor information and Internet access
    by our customers.\n\nIn addition, CPCG deserves special congratulations on their
    outstanding 2Q\nresults - returning to profitability one quarter ahead of what
    was expected!\nAll regions were profitable, contributing to the total $63M in
    operating\nprofit.  The group achieved the best portable shipment quarter on record,\nshipped
    the 100,000th iPAQ desktop, and the iPAQ Pocket PC demand is 10\ntimes the initial
    forecast!  And by the looks of all the commercial products\nwins listed in this
    report, the momentum is continuing.  For an interesting\nQ&A by CNET News.com
    with Mike Winkler on the group's achievement, see:\n<http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-201-2375731-0.html>\n\nNew
    ISSG product announcements and recognition\nISSG has been busy with a lot of new
    product announcements, including the\nindustry's first high-performance network
    attached server appliance, the\nTaskSmart N-Series, new clustering solutions for
    SCO, Oracle and Microsoft.\nMore news includes:\n * The ProLiant 8500 is now Nos.
    2, 3, 4 and 5 Best Performance\non the TPC-C top 10 list.  The Compaq Benchmarks
    result in a Price/tpmC that\nis approximately $10 lower than the top marking IBM
    number and is using SQL\nServer 2000 instead of DB2.  We even pushed the Sun 10000
    off the top 10\nlist.\nCheck out the great review and double awards for the ProLiant
    DL360 by\nInternetWeek Magazine, titled, \"Rack 'Em Up.\"\n<http://www.internetwk.com/reviews00/rev071700.htm>\n\nCompaq
    dominates Commerce One's Global Trading Web portals\nNot only do we power C1's
    own MarketSite.net U.S. portal and all its hosted\ninstallations, but we also
    power an overwhelming number of its major portal\npartners.  These include NTT
    in Japan, which recently replaced its 30 Dell\nservers with Compaq, and Cable
    and Wireless (Optus) in Australia, that,\nafter major firmware problems with Dell,
    is also switching to Compaq.  Let's\nbe bold about stating our dominance in this
    market - especially when\npitching prospective business with other trading exchanges.
    \ I'm sure\nMichael Capellas won't hold back when keynoting at C1's eLink Conference
    in\nLas Vegas next month where we'll demo our Hosting Internet Buying Program\nand
    BuySite and MarketSiteTM solutions.\n\nNA eBusiness Solutions update\n * Great

    Dear Ken:

    Next April 25-27, 2001, Houston will host the 24th conference of the
    International Association for Energy Economics, in combination with the
    annual meeting of our U.S. Association for Energy Economics affiliate.  We
    invite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon
    on Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this
    event.

    Our theme is "2001: An Energy Odyssey." We are using the conference to
    showcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to
    deal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as
    enterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to
    clearly define these major themes and priorities than you.

    I was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in
    Montreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that
    the regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points
    to
    heart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the
    opportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of
    vital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include
    comments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both
    guiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in
    markets on behalf of enterprises.

    The IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business
    and
    university interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring
    you
    up-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure
    Rosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together
    for you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston
    conference
    (at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In
    addition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of
    RD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues
    and Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a
    joint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology
    Conference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.

    Finally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate
    sponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,
    which you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to
    help
    identify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary
    session, "Sustaining Development" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn
    thinking around with our re-phrasing).

    I hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.  We
    look forward to having you with us next April!

  subject: 'Strategy+Business Enews Exclusive: The Last Mile to ... Somewhere?'
  text: "Welcome to s+b's enews, an exclusive new added-value from strategy+business.
    \nThis week:\n\nTHE LAST MILE TO ... SOMEWHERE?\nBy Tim Laseter, Martha Turner,
    Anne Chung, and Pat Houston\n\nNew York, Oct 17, 2000- Last week's announcement
    that the Web-based e-tailer \nand delivery service Urbanfetch was discontinuing
    its business-to-consumer \noperation came as no surprise to us. As we pointed
    out in the August issue of \nstrategy+business, such companies -- highflyers Kozmo.com,
    Webvan, and \nHomeGrocer among them -- face limited online sales potential, high
    cost of \ndelivery, a speed-variety trade-off, and existing, entrenched competition.
    \n\"We believe the last mile may lead to the gallows rather than to the promised
    \nland,\" we wrote.\n\nSince that article appeared, Webvan acquired HomeGrocer,
    Kozmo cancelled its \nplans for an initial public offering, and Urbanfetch closed
    its core \nbusiness. Are we gloating over our prescience? Not at all. We think
    all these \nmoves are signs of maturity -- and indications that one or more players
    may \ndevelop a winning business model.\n\n------------------------------\nTo

  subject: Economics Study on Proposed Houston SIP--Preliminary Results
  text: "You might mark your calendar for a lunch (12-1:30) at the Hyatt downtown
    on \nWednesday December 13 where Barton Smith of UH and George Tolley of the U.
    of \nChicago will present the findings of their economic study.  The Houston Forum
    \nevent will be part of the Kenneth L. Lay Lecture Series in Global Economics
    \nat the University of Houston.  (I will have a table for Enron.)\n\nThe authors
    presented their preliminary results to us this week, and the \ntotal benefits
    of the planned ozone reduction (all SIP measures as currently \nproposed) are
    below $100 million (we are indoors most of the time that bad \nair days are occurring
    since it is typically very hot), and the costs are \naround $5 billion out to
    2010.   Lots of caveats to this conclusion including \nthe assumption of today's
    best technology but no more.  The high costs \ninclude a \"last mile\" problem
    that the proposal of the Partnership's Business \nCoalition for Clean Air (BCCA)
    avoids (such as no noon-to-midnight \nconstruction, a 75% average point source
    reduction to allow for trading and \nfuture permits instead of a 90% reduction,
    etc.).\n\nThe effect on Houston is to reduce our forecast economic growth but
    not \neliminate it.  Real wages are forecast to fall by some 5% or more under
    the \ncurrent SIP versus without it.  Total job loss will be over 100,000--about
    a \n1 and a half years of growth out to 2010.   This \"shock\" will be around
    \none-half of what Houston went through after the oil price crash in 1986 \naccording
    to Dr. Smith.  One might say that slower growth and spreading the \npollution
    around (some of our refinery/petrochemical growth going elsewhere) \nis not the
    end of the world, however, if a more cost-effective SIP is chosen.\n\nIt will
    be several weeks before the results are final (and the election \nover), at which
    time an executive summary will be released.  The Mayor's \noffice and TNRCC will
    be briefed first.  The luncheon will be the formal \nunveiling of the study with
    explanation, but I expect press coverage of the \nstudy next month.\n\nAs head
    of the economics working group, I have tried to ensure that a \ntop-notch analysis
    was done without an industry bias.  The results are \nconsidered conservative
    by the authors all things considered and in line with \nthe peer-reviewed literature
    on costs and benefits.  The study is not \nintended to be a \"whining\" study
    but to give us realistic expectations and to \n(naturally) bring into review some
    \"last mile\" problems where certain SIP \nmeasures are the least cost effective.\n\nThese
    preliminary results are confidential given the political cycle we are \nin and
    should not be shared externally.\n\n- Rob"

  text: "Rep. Archer did a great job today filming the spot.  Fyi, we will put it
    up \non Thursday and hold a news conference that same day with  four Republican
    \nstate reps and preview the spot for TV and the  chronicle.\n?\nWould you send
    Archer a short note thanking  him, Sharon and Don Carlson, his \naide, for their
    excellent  effort?\n?\nThanks. Everything is good. Our four day tracking  poll
    (we are tracking \nevery night except friday and saturday) shows us  up 59-34.
    Give the \nopponents all the undecided and we are still in  shape to coast in
    55-45--a \n20 point turnaround from  '99."

    because more of the media  will show up.\n?\nHer basic statement will be to reinforce
    her  position, as the city's fiscal \nwatchdog, that this will not take one dime
    away  from basic services and will \nindeed help the city keep growing and thus
    have  more funding for city \nservices---especially the $13 million a  year that
    the Arena will generate in \nsales taxes and the increase in property  values
    downtown.\n?\nIt will be great if Mr. Lay could show up at the  event and that
    Sylvia for \nher support and objective analysis of the arena  benefits."

    possibility of moving the meeting to Monday, December 11, from 9:00 a.m. -

    possible, if you could make a Monday meeting.  If not, would December 8

    Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
    inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
    his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
    always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently
    can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
    my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to
    the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
    would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
    content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
    mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it
    comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets
    and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
    don't hesitate to ever ask for a "quid pro quo" from us.

    that it \nwill increase its existing New Jersey TV ad buy by an additional $250,000,
    \nbeginning immediately, and will step up efforts to point out the fiscal \nprofligacy
    associated with Democrat Jon Corzine's economic platform. \n\n?\"We're clearly
    making headway in our effort to educate New Jersey taxpayers \nabout the real
    cost of Corzine's ideas for big government, and we're going to \nturn up the volume
    of our TV buy in New Jersey,\" said Mark Miller, Executive \nDirector of the RLC.?
    \"The bottom line is that Jon Corzine's irresponsible \n'free lunch' big spending
    schemes will ruin our economic prosperity, and send \nthe nation back into deficit
    spending.\" \n\n?The RLC ad, which will be extended in both the Philadelphia and
    New York \nmarkets, charges that Corzine's spending programs would cost the average
    \ntaxpayer $5,000 per year, and quotes a newspaper editorial saying that, \n\"Corzine's...
    schemes would come at a tremendous cost to taxpayers.\" \n\n?Meanwhile, a new
    Quinnipiac College survey of 909 likely New Jersey voters \nreleased today shows
    GOP candidate Bob Franks within five points, 46%-41%, \neven after being outspent
    by Corzine by record margins. \n\n?Miller noted that the new survey shows Corzine
    with an unimpressive 30% - \n26% Favorable/ Unfavorable rating overall, and evenly
    split among \nindependents at 26%. \n\n?\"Because Corzine's message is based almost
    entirely on giving away taxpayers \ndollars for government program after government
    program, taxpayers are \nlooking more skeptically at his proposals,\" said Miller.?
    \"New Jersey \ntaxpayers don't believe Corzine should spend their money as recklessly
    as he \nspends his own money.\" \n\n# # # \nTo subscribe or unsubscribe send your

    The WSJ is doing a profile on Fred and Fialka has asked Fred to suggest
    some people he should talk to about him.  Fialka is particularly interested
    in business leaders who know Fred personally.  If you are willing to talk
    to him I'd appreciate it.  If you feel comfortable in doing so, I  thought
    you might be able to talk about your having worked with him on PCSD and
    other fora - - about the fact that he is passionate about environmental
    issues and the need to achieve results but can work with business and
    politicians of both parties to find ways to solve problems...that he's not
    stuck to one approach...that he's pragmatic, focused on getting results.

    Kenneth,

    Key Customers, Partners, and Suppliers are your company's most valuable
    strategic assets
    as they account either for a majority of the revenues (80/20 rule) or carry
    significant
    investor mindshare.  The problem today is that these crucial relationships
    are complex to manage, involving multiple people, systems, information, and
    processes that cross company boundaries.  As a result, studies show that
    sales teams are spending upto half their time managing day-to-day account
    coordination - taking valuable time away from selling.

    The question is - How can you successfully foster strategic relationships
    while lowering account management costs?

    Our CEO faced this problem when managing relationships like these for a
    leading high-tech company.  She realized, in frustration, that there was no
    infrastructure to manage strategic relationships consistently and
    proactively.  There were front-office automation and CRM applications that
    improved forecasting, sales support and other internal processes, and there
    were personalization applications that pushed information to customers, but
    there was no application that provided a comprehensive customer-driven view
    of strategic relationships.

    So, we developed the Kovair VIPCenter -- a relationship-centered application
    that crosses company boundaries and consolidates all the touchpoints in a
    strategic relationship (people, applications, information, and processes).

    Each VIPCenter is a bi-directional, relationship-specific Web portal that
    fosters long-term collaboration and deeper intimacy with each of your
    strategic partners, suppliers, and customers throughout the relationship
    cycle.

    VIPCenter has a unique extensible application architecture. Out-of-the-box,
    VIPCenter has
    all the core applications needed to manage strategic relationships so you
    can be up and
    running quickly.  And, it is built on Kovair's patented SRM platform,
    providing seamless interoperability with CRM and ERP applications,
    enterprise-class scalability, and extensibility.

    Simply put, Kovair's VIPCenter allows you to build more intimate long-term
    relationships with these key customers, suppliers and partners, while
    lowering account management costs.

    I have attached a Product Data Sheet, Technical Architecture Overview, and a
    White Paper from the Aberdeen Group illustrating the importance of Strategic
    Relationship Management.

    I know it can sometimes be difficult to understand a solution from a simple
    email. For a demonstration, or for more information on how we can help you
    maximize the value of your strategic relationships, please contact me at
    your earliest convenience. I can be reached at 408-546-2014.

    They've told the stations that they expect to add time to the buy. But that
    will be very difficult for them to do next week and it will not be all that
    much any way.

    The Carson "Group" is a one man operation out of a cat ridden house

    Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really \nis difficult
    to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work \nfor the Duchess

    Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
    inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
    his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
    always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given
    recently
    can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
    my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May
    to
    the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
    would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
    content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
    mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when
    it
    comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy
    markets
    and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
    don't hesitate to ever ask for a "quid pro quo" from us.

  subject: P. Walker professorship and keynote request
  text: |-
    Thanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the
    professorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to
    attend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.

    The purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient
    way of reaching you, is two-fold:

         1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney
    C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the
    professorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some
    other area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in
    the College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.
    Both Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into
    Harold Hook to seek his input.

    A few points of elaboration:
         * "Distinguished" is a standard adjective in the titles of such
    positions.
         * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the
    college to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my
    approval.
         * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October
    13.

    This name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,
    (2) allows me to avoid any "turf battles" (either within the college or with
    Economics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the
    college.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.

         2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society
    banquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief
    talk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of
    business.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive
    event.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now
    live in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have
    chosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.
    Your talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed
    (probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.
    I understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the
    morning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable
    for the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in
    choosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you
    will serve as the keynote speaker.

    If you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the
    plans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney
    Walker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if
    you have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is
    573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.

    Let me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not
    Pinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been
    experiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that
    he intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.
    Time permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll
    see him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his
    wife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I
    will host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of
    course, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's
    my understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)

    Ken, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of "R&R"
    during your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.

    Dear Chamber Members,

    The time for you to make a difference is now!

    We have only 10 days until we elect a new president and a new
    Congress, and the U.S. Chamber needs your help.  The U.S.
    Chamber of Commerce represents you - America's business
    community - and now is when we can make a difference.

    Helping to elect pro-business candidates is not something we
    should take for granted. That's why the U.S. Chamber has been
    working hard over the past few months to help pro-business
    candidates get elected. We've endorsed these candidates,
    campaigned on their behalf, donated to their campaigns, and,
    most importantly, lent them the awesome reputation of the U.S.
    Chamber of Commerce.

    We now need your help to make sure we are successful on
    November 7th.  Please take a moment now and visit the
    Elections 2000 page on our web site.  This page can be
    found by going to http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/.

    Once there, click on Pro-Business Candidates and you will find a
    list of the candidates we are actively campaigning for and
    support along with information about their race.  After you select
    a particular candidate, we have also made it possible for you to
    contribute directly to selected campaigns by selecting Contribute
    On-line Now!

    I would also ask that you take a moment to read a recent op-ed by
    U.S. Chamber CEO Tom Donohue.  This op-ed titled - Business
    As the Target - highlights the attacks the business community is
    under from anti-business candidates.  I also feel it underscores the
    importance of helping to elect and voting for pro-business
    candidates!

    To read Mr. Donohue's op-ed, please click here -
    http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/_Business+as+the+Target.htm

    Or, to help elect pro-business candidates, please:

    1. Visit http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/
    2. Click on Pro-Business Candidates
    3. Select the candidate you would like to support!
    4. Make a contribution of $150, $100, $75, or $50 directly to their campaign!

    Please feel free to email me if you have any questions or if I can be of
    assistance to you.  And, thank you for helping us to elect candidates
    who support business!

    Sincerely,

    Bill Miller
    Political Director


    P.S.  Please visit http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/, select a
    pro-business candidate, and make a contribution directly to their
    campaign.  Remember there are only 10 days left until the
    election, so they need support from the business community now.

    I wanted to make sure you were aware of something that has come up since
    the last breakfast meeting regarding our group financing the Arena parking
    garage.  Baker & Botts put us in touch with the Rockets to discuss Hines
    being the Development Manager on the Arena and garage.  Although not fully
    agreed, there is strong interest on both sides.  Besides help on the
    development front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a
    buffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any
    issues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providing
    development management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker & Botts) have
    talked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this
    should "be the Authority's idea.".  One issue is how much of our fee would
    apply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much
    would apply to the Arena.  Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted you
    to know about this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.
    If you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting, please
    give me a call at 713-966-2606.

    Also, on another topic, we have been doing a tiny bit of pie in the sky
    brainstorming on the concept of creating some kind of Futures/Options
    market in the commercial space market.  I will approach Jeff Skilling
    unless you would recommend elsewhere within Enron.

    \nSubject: Duchess of Northumbria's request\n\nKen\n\nThanks for sending me the
    request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help \nwith her garden project.  I
    have discussed this with John Wakeham and our \nview is that unless you have any
    other reason for helping with this, we \nshould say a polite \"no\".\n\nThe background
    is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, \nManaging Director
    of Lurgi Invent.\n\nAlnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex
    region so it really \nis difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has
    done a little work \nfor the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.
    \ However, this \nbusiness currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant
    to see \nany sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.\n\nGiven the nature of the project,
    the approach from the Duchess and the fact \nthat she can clearly afford to pay
    for it herself, we really do believe no is \nthe right answer.\n\nPlease let me
    know if you want any further information or if you want me to \ncorrespond direct
    with the Duchess.\n\nBest wishes.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    ENRON ANOUNCES EMPLOYEE PROGRAM
    On October 5, Enron announced "it will give employees of its wholly owned
    subsidiaries a high-speed computer and Internet connection, including
    broadband connectivity, for use at home, beginning in 2001.   .......Through
    a company-wide computer drive, employees will be able to donate their
    existing home computers to Technology For All (www.techforall.org) , a
    national program working to bridge the digital divide."   Technology For All
    thanks Ken Lay for his leadership in this decision that also helps TFA serve
    America's underserved and disadvantaged.
    For more information, the full press release is located at
    http://www4.enron.com/corp/pr/releases/2000/ene/87-PC-Enron.html .


    $45 MILLION SMARTFORCE DONATION TO BE ANNOUNCED NOVEMBER 15
    On November 15 TFA and SmartForce
    (http://www.smartforce.com/corp/marketing/default.htm ) will post a joint
    press release announcing the donation of 450,000 scholarships for SmartForce
    eLearning courses to be delivered through the TFA secure website to end
    users seeking training with TFA collaborative program partners across the
    US.  The 600 online courses available through the program are in English and
    Spanish and include everything from computer basics to various levels of
    technical certification. This generous gift to TFA will be utilized over a
    three year period and has a retail value of approximately $45 million. A key
    component of the gift will be the inclusion of a "SmartJobs" section on the
    web site that will list companies doing business with SmartForce that have
    pledged to interview job applicants who successfully complete training
    through a TFA/SmartForce course. Scott Yeager will call Greg Priest, CEO of
    Smarforce, on behalf of TFA and thank him for this generous gift toward the
    Technology For All initiative.

    AMERICA CONNECTS CONSORTIUM
    TFA is working with the America Connects Consortium (ACC) to help support
    Community Technology Centers across the US. The ACC received recently
    received a $2 million Department of Education  grant to support CTC efforts.
    The benefits to TFA include program support for existing TFA programs and
    the ability to share best practices across the US. The consortium will
    assist TFA in its city by city model by helping encourage exisiting
    organizations to work together. In addition to sharing TFA online content
    TFA will also host online curriculum resources created by the consortium on
    the private side of our web site.  The work of the Consortium will begin
    with an organizational meeting in Boston, November 15-16.  For more
    information read the full release posted on the TFA web site at.
    http://www.techforall.org/showdoc.cfm?id=35&ret=new

    BLUECURRENT RELATIONSHIP FINALIZED
    TFA recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Bluecurrent.  Through
    the relationship Bluecurrent will assist TFA with the management and
    donation of corporate technology assets across the US.  Through the creative
    use of donated assets as "currency" the Bluecurrent relationship will save
    TFA $13.5 million in projected cash expenses over the next five years to
    process and redeploy corporate technology assets donated to TFA.  In
    addition, we believe this relationship will dramatically increase the
    computers available to TFA and its program partners.  For more information
    about Bluecurrent go to http://www.bluecurrent.com .

    LINCT COALITION "LEARN AND EARN" PROGRAM TO EMPOWER
    One of the beneficiaries of the Bluecurrent relationship will be the ability
    of TFA to more quickly rollout the TFA/LINCT coalition "Learn and Earn"
    Program. This program will allow disadvantaged persons who participate in
    the program to learn how to use a computer and then mentor another person
    using the same curriculum. By completing both parts of this cross-age peer
    tutoring program, participants will then "earn" a computer to take home,
    thus creating new opportunities for education and economic empowerment.
    More information about the LINCT coalition "learn and earn" program can be
    found at http://www.linct.org/

    DIGITAL DIVIDENDS CONFERENCE, SEATTLE
    Two weeks ago I attended the Digital Dividends Conference in Seattle.  The
    focus of the Conference was "creating digital dividends" and exploreing
    innovative approaches to closing the global digital divide.  The conference
    was hosted by the World Resources Institute, chaired by William D.
    Ruckelshaus, and reviewed business modesl and market development strategies
    to close the digital divide.  I made several important connections at the
    conference including key personnel with Hewlett Packard.  Carly Fiorina,
    HP's CEO, announced a huge global initiative by Hewlett Packard to address
    the digital divide in 1000 villages across the world.

    ASIA FOUNDATION RELATIONSHIP BEING DEVELOPED
    Through the introduction of Enron lobbyist David Merrill, former ambassador
    to Bangladesh during the Bush adminstration, TFA met last week with the
    President and several staff members of the Asia Foundation. The Asia
    Foundation supports economic development and other efforts in Asia and is
    funded by private contributions and the US State Department. The Asia
    Foundation indicated an interest in working together with TFA in the future
    as Enron expands its backbone to Japan and other Asian countries.

    LAY AND TROTTER ASSIST IN FUNDRAISING EFFORTS
    TFA and its local affiliate Technology For All-Houston are working together
    to follow through on grant requests of $5 million over a three year period
    from Houston area foundations.  We have had initially o\positive responses
    from Houston Endowment and the Brown Foundation as well as several smaller
    foundations including the Hamman Foundation and the Sterling Turner
    Foundation. We are also preparing requests to Houston area corporations and
    friends of TFA that will go out in the next few weeks.  A bridge loan from
    the Redstone bank has been secured to get us through the next couple of
    months. TFA anticipates a need for $4.5 million in cash over the next twelve
    months to help us build capacity and long term sustainability.  With the
    creative business relationships being created we expect to be able to insure
    sustainability of the organization after the initial capacity is secured.
    However, until that time, TFA will be dependent upon the cash and in-kind
    contributions of foundations, corporations, its board members and friends.

    PROGRESS CONTINUES ON IVERCITY DEAL
    The IverCity "deal" is an example of an innovative and creative solution for
    long-term sustainability.  Through the co-branding of the TFA/IverCity web
    site, we hope to drive web users to IverCity content and thus create the
    potential for a IverCity liquidity event that will benefit TFA's long term
    capital needs.  Jack Clark has done a superb job creating the draft of the
    legal document outlining the deal.  We thank Jack Trotter for his suggestion
    to create a convertible royalty rather than just equity by itself.  The
    benefit to TFA is the ability for TFA to be compensated by the number of
    users we direct to the IverCity content which will be useful to TFA
    constituents.

    ROSEMARIE FOSTER TO JOIN TFA AS ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT
    Effective, November 20, Rosemarie Foster will be joining the TFA staff
    fulltime as administrative assistant.  She will begin working some partime
    hours this week. Thanks to Jack Trotter and Jack Clark for providing office
    space for Rosemarie.  Additional TFA staff are being c\interviewed to assist
    with fund-raising, program development, web site development and network
    infrastructure support.

    DISCUSSIONS WITH INTERNET POLICY INSTITUTE
    Justin Cornett represented TFA recently at a "town hall" meeting of the
    Internet Policy Institute (IPI) in Austin.  The IPI will be working with TFA
    in our Washington DC rollout. We will be meeting with them again next week
    in DC. We thank Ken Lay for his initial introductions to the board members
    and staff of the IPI.

    NEW YORK, LOS ANGELES, WASHINGTON DC, SAN DIEGO, ATLANTA
    Through introductions from TFA board members and others we are beginning to
    develop key contacts in each of the cities noted above. Board assistance
    will be required as we also seek to develop co-branding corporate
    relationships.  As per the wishes of the board, we are focused on New York,
    Washington DC, and Los Angeles first.  We will keep you posted and request
    your assistance as appropriate.

    ROAD-SHOW.COM DONATES WEBCAST PRODUCTION
    Road-Show.com, an Enron customer, recently donated a webcast for TFA to
    utilize on its website.  The url for the site is listed below and will soon
    be accessible from TFA's web site as well.

    in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you \nby phone or e-mail before Governor
    Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? \nGovernor Knowles (classmate of George W.),
    along with Governor Taft of Ohio, \nhas enlisted us in a conference that seven
    governors are sponsoring on \nnatural gas in order to elucidate the market and
    issues -- and needs -- \nbefore it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps
    helps head it off (in \ncontrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles
    is the current \nchairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will
    be under the \nauspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and
    a lot of \nother distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely
    event.\n\nThey would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be
    kicking \noff the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high visibility

    \nyou in that featured role in it works for your schedule.\n\nIt takes place in
    Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. \n\nTony is a very good guy, and of course natural
    gas as well as oil looms very \nlarge for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.?
    He can certainly fill you in \nfurther on what they would like to accomplish.\n\nIf
    it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, \nthat
    would be great. \n\nOn behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration.

    Dear Ken:

    This is a brief note to thank you for taking the time to serve as a
    reference for me.  Your continued support of both my professional and
    personal development is deeply appreciated.  You are a fine role model and
    someone who continues to inspire me to strive further.

    I have taken a job as President and CEO of ChainDrugStore.net, a web based
    B2B information exchange.  We are based in Alexandria, Va.  My boss and
    Chairman of our Board is Craig Fuller.  You may remember that Craig was Vice
    President Bush's Chief of Staff.

    Let's keep our fingers crossed on GW--looks good, but too close for comfort.
    I keep in regular touch with my friends Larry Lindsey, Bob Grady and Bob
    Zoellick--understand they serve on an advisory board for Enron.

    Ken, thanks again for everything and keep my ESOP investment growing.

    Best,

    Brad Mitchell

  subject: Transactions in Lilly Stock
  text: |
    This is a reminder of your ongoing obligation to report to the Securities
    and Exchange Commission ("SEC") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of
    the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe
    penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any
    transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,
    including:

    -   purchases
    -   sales
    -   gifts
    -   trust or partnership transactions
    -   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
    -   exchange fund transactions

    We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
    reasons:

       There are certain times when you should not engage in market
       transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these "black-outs" occur around
       the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
       announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of "inside
       information" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
       reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
       While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
       you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
       legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

    Hodge Joins Tax Foundation as Executive Director; Fleenor Named Chief
    Economist

    Washington, D.C. August 29, 2000 -- Scott Hodge has been named executive
    director of the Tax Foundation. Most recently he has worked as director of
    tax and budget policy at Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation and is
    recognized as one of Washington's leading experts on the federal budget. He
    has been widely published on fiscal policy, notably in the pages of The Wall
    Street Journal, The Washington Post, USA Today, and The Washington Times.
    His work as Senior Budget Analyst at the Heritage Foundation included the
    editing of three books on the federal budget. Mr. Hodge has been a
    commentator on nightly news shows such as NBC Nightly News and CBS Nightly
    News, and has been seen regularly on CNN, Fox Network, and C-SPAN.
    At the same time, Patrick Fleenor has been named the Foundation's chief
    economist. On staff at the Tax Foundation since 1993, Fleenor has improved
    the Foundation's core research projects, such as Tax Freedom Day and The
    Federal Tax Burden by State, and he has published extensive economic
    analyses of excise and estate taxes. Fleenor has a reputation among the
    media as a reliable source for tax data on myriad subjects.
    Hodge and Fleenor replace J.D. Foster who held both titles from 1993 to June
    of this year, when he announced his departure for the staff of Rep. Phil
    Crane (R-IL). Foster will be legislative director and economic counsel to
    Rep. Crane, who is currently the second-ranking Republican on the House Ways
    and Means Committee, and chairman of its subcommittee on trade.

    News from Los Angeles in the Los Angeles Times
    Riordan to Join L.A. Unified After He Leaves City Hall
     <<...>> Mayor: In an address to Valley leaders, he strongly denounces
    secession, then makes surprising disclosure about plan to take executive
    post with district.
    By JIM NEWTON, Times Staff Writer


    In his final annual address on the state of the San Fernando Valley, Los
    Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan on Friday delivered his most forceful call
    ever for that area to remain part of the larger city, then surprised the
    audience by announcing that he will go to work for the Los Angeles Unified
    School District when he finishes his term in office.
    Speaking to a group of Valley business leaders, Riordan denounced secession
    on political, moral and practical grounds, warning that it would force a tax
    hike, leave the Valley with uncertain leadership and abandon the city's
    poor.
    "I love the Valley," Riordan said. "I feel that you're part of the family,
    and I don't want you to desert the family. . . . The rest of the city needs
    you. You can't abandon the poor. It just isn't right."
    Riordan's pointed rejection of secession represents a significant escalation
    in his efforts to head off that politically charged prospect--a topic so
    heated that in a mayoral debate following Riordan's speech, not one of the
    six candidates angling for election in April so much as mentioned the word.
    Riordan, by contrast, tackled the issue head-on and in far more
    confrontational terms than he ever has before.
    "Secession," Riordan said bluntly, "is a lousy idea."
    As significant as that pronouncement was, however, the mayor almost
    overshadowed it with an offhand personal remark in response to a question
    after his speech. Asked to elaborate on his thoughts about breaking up the
    school district, Riordan let slip that he intends to go to work for L.A.
    Unified after he finishes his second term as mayor, which ends next summer.
    The mayor, who helped elect four of the school board's seven members, said
    he has been in discussions with Supt. Roy Romer and has agreed to accept an
    "executive position" with the district next year. Riordan did not elaborate,
    but in an interview later, he said he and the superintendent had agreed that
    Riordan would run the district's classroom computer program.
    The former Colorado governor, who now runs the city's schools, was not
    immediately available for comment.
    At the district, Riordan said, he will be in charge of working with schools
    to make effective use of computers in the classroom. Riordan, who has
    donated thousands of computers to schools in various parts of the country,
    said the job fit his talents. "I think this is something I'm good at," he
    said. "I know the experts in the field."
    Riordan's post-mayoral plans have for months been the object of much
    speculation. Most observers predicted he would do something in the field of
    education, because no topic animates Riordan as much as children and
    schools.
    But Riordan is a multimillionaire, and he will be over 70 when he finishes
    his second term as mayor. He passed up the chance to run for governor in
    1998, and some friends had predicted he would slow down when he wrapped up
    his mayoral administration.
    The idea of a quiet retirement, however, seems to have little appeal for
    Riordan, an energetic and restless man. Asked how long he intended to take
    off between finishing his work as mayor and starting his new job at the
    school district, Riordan responded: "three or four hours."
    Riordan has held office for nearly eight years, and for that entire time has
    enjoyed the strong support of the San Fernando Valley. It was the Valley
    that helped put him in office in 1993, and polls since have shown that
    though he is popular citywide, he enjoys his greatest approval ratings north
    of the Hollywood Hills.
    As the race to succeed him gathers steam, some of the candidates clearly
    covet Riordan's base in the Valley.
    On Friday, City Councilman Joel Wachs often invoked the mayor's name during
    a low-energy debate among the six leading mayoral candidates. Among other
    things, Wachs praised Riordan's economic development initiatives and his
    handling of the recently completed negotiations between the city and federal
    government over the future of the Los Angeles Police Department.
    So effusive was Wachs in his praise of Riordan that eventually businessman
    Steve Soboroff complained. As Soboroff pointed out to the audience, Riordan
    has endorsed his candidacy, not Wachs'. Soboroff suggested that his rival
    withdraw from the race and back him instead.
    Wachs laughed, but did not respond.
    The debate--really more of a panel discussion in which the candidates rarely
    addressed one another, while sitting cheek-by-jowl in straight-backed
    chairs--also was notable as the first joint appearance of the candidates to
    include state Controller Kathleen Connell, the latest contender to join the
    race.
    Connell used her debut debate performance to stress her determination to
    bring tough fiscal management to the problems of Los Angeles. She addressed
    issues such as police corruption, transportation and the city's business
    climate in terms of their economic impact, arguing that her experience in
    the private sector and as controller made her the right person to handle
    that task.
    In other debate highlights, City Atty. James Hahn and Assemblyman Antonio
    Villaraigosa enthusiastically welcomed the signing of the consent decree
    with the federal government on police reform.
    Connell, Wachs and U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra also applauded the deal, though
    in less glowing terms.
    Soboroff was the only candidate to oppose it, calling it an abdication of
    local responsibility.

    Peter,

    Materials have been sent to the contacts you made for TFA in LA. Beyond that
    I have been focused recently on finalizing the TFA relationships with
    Smartforce and IverCity.Com.  We will announce the Smartforce donation (450K
    eLearning scholarships over three years) at a meeting in Boston on November
    15.  This is a huge gift ($30-$45 million in retail value).  I have been in
    contact (phone and face to face visits) with several nonprofit groups in LA
    involved in local initiatives there.  Some of these groups are working
    together and some are not.  15,000 ($1.5 million in value) of the Smartforce
    eLearning courses are reserved for LA and could be utilized by local groups
    there if they can work together. It is my hope that TFA can help encourage
    that. One of the issues, of course, is identifying other potential
    co-branding corporations/foundations that can help bring the necessary
    dollars to the table. In-kind donations have been relatively easy to
    accumulate. Finding the necessary cash is more difficult. I do agree with
    you that Mayor Riordan's future plans could be good for TFA.  Perhaps we can
    talk by phone in the next day or two to follow through on some of our
    previous discussions.  I will be in Washington DC later in the week to meet
    with the Internet Policy Institute, the Pew Foundation and others.


    I have also been following through on some contacts in DC and New York City.
    Again, we will need co-branding relationships with $'s and in-kind resources
    to make this work.

    Will

  subject: Get out the Vote
  text: |-
    Dear Friends and Family,
    We are down to the wire and the race couldn't be
    closer. Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas.
    Please, remember to vote and go early, polls open at
    7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put
    it off until 7pm as there could be lines and the
    supervisors are not required to keep the polls open
    after 7pm for those in line.
    Remind your friends and family to vote and if someone
    needs transportation to the polls, give them a ride or
    call your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or
    your local Democratic campaign office, they will have
    people available to transport people to the polls.
    Keep an eye out while you are at the polls for
    electoral fraud and report any suspicious activity
    including inappropriate campaigning to the poll
    watchers at the polls. The Democrats and the
    Republicans will have representatives at most of the
    polls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.
    Finally, if you have time, call your local offices and
    offer your time to make phone calls to encourage
    people to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to
    be available to help prevent of voter fraud.

    Finally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come
    in. There are election watch parties everywhere!!!

    Just one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's
    from me and everyone else)!
    Take care and VOTE!
    Liz

  text: "Ken,  thanks for agreeing to meet with Stedman Graham at two this afternoon.
    \ \nThe following should give you some talking points and background:\n\n Stedman
    Graham is most noted for being the companion to Oprah Winfrey, \nhowever he is
    CEO of two firms which are in the marketing and educational \nconsulting business.\n\n
    Enron has been discussing using Graham's consulting services for our \nAssociate
    program to focus on leadership training and develop.\n\n We are considering him
    as a potential advisory board member for Enron \nInvestment Partners.  This will
    be our first meeting with him so we are not \nyet ready to propose a board seat
    yet.\n\n We also hope that any relationship we develop with him could lead to
    a \nconnection with Oprah Winfrey for the purpose of further expanding the \npublicity
    for EIP and Enron and also to  access additional investment dollars.\n\n Prior
    to your meeting we will have introduced him to EIP and Enron so he \nshould be
    well briefed on the company.  I think it would be good if you could \nfocus on
    the activities of EIP and the reason why Enron would be supportive \nof this type
    of business since that is always a question that comes up.  I \nunderstand that
    Linda will join us during the meeting and want to talk about \nthe Holocaust Museum
    and Oprah's potential involvement with it.\n\n Also with us will be Danny Lawson
    whom you have met.  Danny was the mayor's  \nchief fund raiser for the last two
    elections and is very active locally.  \nLast Friday Danny facilitated a meeting
    between EES and Jew Don Boney for the \npurpose of moving along the potential
    energy services contract between EES \nand the city of Houston.  He has been a
    strong supporter of ours for quite \nsome time and is also a candidate for the
    advisory board.  Danny currently \nsets on the Cynet board.\n\n Please let me
    know if there is any other information that would be useful\n\nGene"

  subject: Your Question on HMS
  text: "Dr. Lay:\n\nAs you know, Enron owns a minority interest in Hanover Compressor
    Corp.   On \nseveral ocassions, Mel Klein of GKH has discussed the possibility
    that Enron \npurchase GKH's interest in Hanover.  This is an option that ENA has
    not \nrecommended to date, as I understand that at current prices we are more
    of a \nseller than a buyer.  Jeff Donahue is responsible for this investment and
    can \nanswer any specific questions.\n\nIn respect to HMS,  Enron and Hanover
    established Hanover Measurement \nServices (HMS) as a joint venture to provide
    pipeline measurement services.  \nHMS is structured as an (Enron:Hanover)  49:51
    equity and 50:50 control \npartnership.  Enron and Hanover each have 2 representatives
    on the Board.\n\nEnron (through Houston Pipe Line)  invested $2.5MM of initial
    capital in HMS \nand entered into a measurement service contract with HMS.  HMS
    has also \nentered into a service contract with Kinder Morgan and is seeking to
    enter \ninto similar contracts with other pipelines.  \n\nPotential HMS Topics
    of Discussion\n\n1. Enron is in the processing of selling HPL - the service contract
    between \nHPL and HMS will be assigned to the  purchaser of HPL.  \n\n2. Enron
    will retain its interest in HMS, but we are open to both Enron and \nHanover selling

  subject: Secretary of Defense-sponsored Highlands Forum
  text: |-
    Dear Mr. Lay:

    On behalf of Assistant Secretary of Defense (C3I) and DoD CIO Arthur Money,
    I would like to invite you to participate in the Secretary of Defense's
    Highlands Forum. The Highlands Forum is a cross-disciplinary group of
    eminent scholars, researchers, CEO's/CIO's/CTO's from industry, and leaders
    from the media, the arts and the professions, who have met over the past six
    years to examine areas of emerging interest to all of us.  The idea is to
    gain a better understanding of the new environment we will all be living and
    working in, and to examine the fundamental changes that will impact that
    environment.  The Forum includes seniors from the White House, Defense, and
    other agencies of government (we limit government participation to about
    25%).  Our meetings over the past six years have covered such diverse topics
    as "The Mind, the Brain, and Computing"; "The Convergence of Information
    Technology and Biotechnology"; and "Innovation in Public Sector
    Organizations".  Our meeting in May explored MEMS, nanotechnology, and
    molecular computing; among our participants were: Sun Microsystems founder
    Bill Joy, Phil Kuekes of HP, Nobel laureate Rick Smalley. Our last meeting
    in September focused on the future of software, and participants included
    Inktomi founder Eric Brewer, SUN CTO Greg Papadopoulos, Packet Design CEO
    Judy Estrin (board member of FedEx and Cisco), and Esther Dyson.

    The Forum is an idea engine--there are no reports and no consensus
    recommendations. Meeting size is usually kept to around 30 people to remain
    small and informal, encouraging maximum discussion of ideas presented by a
    speaker or a panel; we call it strategic conversation.  While there is media
    participation in our meetings, there is no press coverage of the
    discussions.  Our distinguised media participants in this meeting (CEO, UPI;
    Exec. Editor, International Herald Tribune) will take part representing
    themselves and will  act as moderators.

    Several of our participants strongly suggested that I contact you to tell
    you about the Forum and this particular meeting. We are going to hold
    Highlands Forum 16 in Washington, DC, on December 14-15 (half day on the
    15th).  The topic will be built around the search for
    information/transformation strategies for the Department of Defense (and
    government in general). The Assistant Secretary would like to hold this
    Highlands to think about the elements of an information strategy, and I have
    suggested that we look at information and strategy from a business
    perspective (transformation, productivity, competitive advantage).  We will
    look at  4 or 5 useful business cases for context.  ENRON is a remarkable
    example of transformation in a highly rigid, regulated industry, that has
    created a new model and new markets.

    The Defense Department is not only creating an operational strategy which
    has information superiority (better, faster decision making) at its core;
    the Department also has an enormous global business enterprise which can
    benefit from many of the best practices and ideas from industry enabling it
    to achieve greater efficiencies and be a better steward of public funds.
    Clearly, not all the elements translate well from the business envrionment,
    however, many do.  I am interested in business cases which ideally describe
    an enterprise-level information or transformation strategy--those which see
    an information strategy as the overarching strategy, or at least as a core
    component of corporate/operational strategy--use of information technology,
    information protection/assurance, CRM, and perhaps how to use information
    and technology to transition or capture or create a new market. One
    operational example that we will look at is Cemex, the Mexican cement
    company that uses I.T. (GPS and communications) to "swarm" its trucks in the
    ready cement business. Their COO will be joining us to describe how they
    succeeded in dominating their market. In addition to Cemex, other companies
    represented in our agenda include Cisco, eBay, Schwab, and Sourceree.

    ENRON is of great interest to us.  What we learn from you may help the
    Department of Defense a great deal as it works to build a new strategy. I
    hope that you have time on your busy schedule to join us for as much of the
    Highlands Forum as you can attend and speak with the group. I would be happy
    to tell you more about the Forum.  In the meantime, please take a look at
    the Secretary's Website for the Forum to get a better idea of what it is and
    what is has accomplished: www.hlforum.com; username: cc27 (lowercase);
    password: SVN8 (Uppercase). I am also attaching a short document which gives

    I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you with a revision of the
    paper.

    Attached please find a revised summary by Tim Koller.  We hope it reflects
    well the discussion of our previous meeting. Before the next meeting, it is

    this summary.  I suggest this next meeting take place as a conference call
    at one of the following times.  Please indicate with an "X" in the boxes
    next to the proposed dates which dates are good for you.

                   Monday, November 20, 5 p.m. EST     [ X  ]

                   Tuesday, November 21, 5 pm EST      [   ]

                   Monday November 27, 6 pm EST        [ X  ]


    We would like to get everyone's views in advance of this conference call,
    either in writing or by phone.  Please indicate below what your preference
    would be.  If a call is preferred, Valerie Petersen will contact your
    office
    to set it up.


                   Call [   ]

                   Writing   [   ]

    There will be one last meeting scheduled after the conference call meeting
    takes place to go over the final draft.

    Look forward to hearing from you.

    Thanks very much,
    Jeff

  subject: India "CPIL" Supreme Court Case
  text: "The Supreme Court hearing for the case in India regarding the alleged \nimproper
    bidding and award of the Panna/Mukta block concluded today.  Our \nlegal team's
    opinion is very optimistic based on the way the proceeding \nprogressed and also
    on the actions of the chief judge during the concluding \narguments of the case
    today in India. \n\nThe panel of three judges will now take approximately 2 months
    to write their \nopinion and that should complete this case.  While I probably
    shouldn't  \nspeculate on the outcome, I will summarize my opinion of the important
    \npoints:  1) there is little doubt that the Panna/Mukta award to \nEnron/Reliance/ONGC
    will stand, and  2) it is highly unlikely that the judges \nwill request the PSC
    to be renegotiated, the contract was portrayed and \ngenerally accepted by the
    panel as a very fair deal for the GOI.  According \nto my general counsel, Stephen
    Wallace, the only concern our team has is that \nthe judges were quite critical
    of the CBI (the government group that \ninvestigated Reliance for wrong doing
    in the bid process) during that portion \nof the testimony and there is a possibility
    that they could request an \nadditional investigation.  Our team puts the likelihood
    of the judges \nordering a new investigation at less than 50%.  There is downside
    to such a \ndecision in that it creates uncertainty, but the focus would be on
    Reliance, \nnot Enron. \n\nEnron was very prepared on the commercial and the legal
    front and our team, \nas expected, carried the load for this case even though
    we were not the \nprimary defendants.  Enron presented the major rebuttal to the
    CPIL \nassertions because the others were not prepared and then later \"coached\"
    the \nothers to help them prepare appropriately.   This was a much more intensive
    \ncase than people were assuming it would be last year and we were very \nfortunate
    to be extremely well prepared and well represented.   \n\nBased on the above information,
    \ I do not think this issue \"CPIL lawsuit\"  \nshould  impact any future decisions
    we make regarding the Panna/ Mukta/Tapti \nassets.  This outcome basically eliminates
    one of the two issues impeding the \nprogress of  the  project I showed Joe, our
    proposal to sell \nPanna/Mukta/Tapti, that we call Project Janus.  We believe
    we have a unique \nopportunity to realize exceptional value for these assets through
    an \narrangement with our partner.  The strategy we have mapped out should  allow
    \nus to close the transaction prior to year-end and it has very positive cash
    \nflow and neutral financial implications (minimal if any gain due to the \nstep-up
    last year) for the company.   The only remaining hurdle is a tax \nissue that
    we are currently working. \n\njeff"

    We are already receiving several inquiries regarding the upcoming
    Presidential Inauguration.  Enclosed is information pertaining to everything
    from hotel accommodations and travel to the Texas State Society Black Tie
    and Boots Inaugural Ball, which is the official Presidential Inaugural Ball
    for the State of Texas.

    Furthermore, I would like you to notice that several of the hotels in
    Washington, DC are not taking reservations until November 8, 2000.  In order
    to reserve a room for the Inauguration, you might want to begin calling
    hotels at the open of business on that day.  You will find a compiled list
    of many hotels on pages four through six in the attached information.
    Please make a note that most hotels require a minimum length of stay of four
    nights.  You will want to plan accordingly.

    In addition, I do not recommend that you rent a vehicle during your stay.
    Due to the large number of people in Washington at this time, driving will
    be next to impossible.  It is in your best interest to utilize the Metro
    system or to take a cab.

    I hope you find the enclosed to be useful.  Please feel free to call my
    office at 202.225.2231 or email Jenny Sheffield at
    jenny.sheffield@mail.house.gov if there is anything else that I can do to be
    of assistance.  I look forward to seeing you in January!

    Dear Mr. kenneth L. Lay :
            Mr. Kenneth D. Rice :

    I joined press conference on October 31 in Tokyo.

    I would like to know more about Enron Online, because many Japanese
    equipment, component and material manufacturers are interested in and know.

    Now I am moving by business trip in the U.S.A. and I will go to Houston on
    November 14 and 15. I would like to meet with business development,
    marketing, or sales people in Enron Online. I appreciate if you or anybody
    make an arrangement to meet.

    I am lookingforward to your kind response.

  text: "Ken -- You are scheduled to do a 30-minute telephone interview on Thursday
    at \n9:30 a.m. with Heidrick & Struggles, which is publishing a journal for the
    \nWorld Economic Forum meeting in Davos in January 2001.  This publication will
    \ncover corporate leadership and human capital issues in the new economy.  They
    \nwant to talk to you for a chapter on \"Leading a Transformation into the New
    \nEconomy.\"   The interviewer will be Stephen Miles, and he has submitted the
    \nfollowing questions in advance of your conversation.  I will come to your \noffice
    at 9:30 a.m. to place the call.\n\nThank you.\nKaren \n\n\n\n 1. Enron over the
    past decade has become the most vigorous change agent\n in its industry.  From
    a leadership perspective, how have you created a\n culture of change in an industry
    not known for change?\n\n 2. Nortel Networks has clearly made an outstanding transformation
    into\n the New Economy, similar to Enron's evolution. In Nortel's case, John Roth\n
    bought Bay Networks and infused the Nortel culture with Bays - almost a\n reverse
    cultural transformation.  How did you create a New Economy culture\n where innovation,
    risk-taking and new ideas are embraced and rewarded?\n\n 3. Are there some best
    practices you can share with other CEOs and\n Managing Directors regarding leading
    a change?\n\n 4. At best, change is difficult. But being able to change before
    you\n have to has only been accomplished successfully by a few companies.  How\n
    did you lead a change effort when you were arguably still a very\n successful
    utility?\n\n 5. Peter Drucker has said than in stable time you need good management\n
    but in disruptive times you need leadership.  How have you been able to\n attract
    and retain what Fortune magazine has called the best management\n team?\n\n 6.
    The New Economy is really all about creating a culture of\n innovation, where
    employees see opportunity and not barriers. Enron has\n been masterful at this
    from gas, to electricity, pulp & paper, and now\n bandwidth. As the \"keeper of
    the culture\" how did you establish and\n maintain such a culture?\n\n 7. As Enron
    moves away from Plant, Property and Equipment towards\n Intangible Assets, what
    has changed for you as a leader in the age of\n intangibles?\n\n 8. Can you list
    the four or five \"must have\" competencies for the 21st\n Century CEO? What experiences
    are necessary?\n\n 9. Lets talk about going global. You have made very impressive
    in-roads\n in India where no other utility has been able to. How did you lead
    this\n effort? Are there any best practices you can share with your fellow CEO's\n
    who are thinking about India?\n\n 10. Lets now move to Europe. Enron is the largest
    gas and power trader\n in Europe. Can you discuss your move into Europe? Again
    are there some\n best practices for CEOs in the USA moving into Europe?"

    November 8, 2000
    Calif Regulators,Grid Oper In Turf War Over Generation By JASON LEOPOLD Of
    DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES-California's electricity regulators and
    power-grid operator are locked in a turf war over who has the authority to
    order new power plant construction next summer to ensure the state has
    enough juice on hand when demand soars.
    The California Public Utilities Commission says it can bring emergency
    power on line at a fraction of the cost that the Independent System
    Operator is expected to pay independent power producers for the same
    service.
    Under it's plan, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Edison
    International's (EIX) Southern California Edison unit and Sempra Energy's
    (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric Co. were ordered to submit documents by the
    end of November stating whether they can build and operate "peaking" plants
    by June 1.
    The utilities weren't immediately available to comment.
    On the other hand, the ISO - which is on the verge of signing contracts for
    440 peaking units with between 20 and 91 megawatts of electricity - says
    the commission's meddling could endanger any chance of additional resources
    coming on line in time.
    "Any further interference on the state level could destroy the plan
    altogether," said an ISO source close to the issue. "There is no guarantee
    the utilities will be able to pull this off by next summer. And if the
    whole project is scrapped, you can expect there will be blackouts."
    Interference by federal regulators has already cost the ISO two
    participants and nearly 600 megawatts in its peaking program.
    Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Enron (ENE) initially agreed to build peaking
    plants for the ISO next summer, but withdrew their offers after the Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission proposed capping the clearing price for
    California's wholesale electricity market at $150 a megawatt-hour.
    The ISO, which operates one of the state's wholesale power markets and
    manages most of the high-voltage transmission grid, has already solicited
    and received bids from merchant generators for 1,800 megawatts of new
    peaking power for next summer.
    Burned by the summer's power crisis and facing an 8,000-MW shortfall next
    summer, the ISO put out a request for bids in August. The ISO's board voted
    Oct. 30 to enter into the contracts, which it estimated would cost about
    $250 million a year for three years.
    The state's Electricity Oversight Board, which oversees the performance of
    the ISO, and the Public Utilities Commission protested the decision on the
    grounds that the contracts were too expensive.
    The commission is also questioning whether there is even a need for peaking
    power next summer and, if there is, whether the ISO should handle the
    solicitation.
    "The question also arises as to whether the ISO - which is empowered only
    to operate the state's transmission system and which does not represent the
    state or its consumers - is the appropriate organization to plan, solicit
    and pay for the construction of new power plants across the state," the
    commission wrote in its Nov. 2 order.
    Ind the end, the decision is up to state regulators. If utilities can come
    up with a cheaper alternative and if the regulators determine that
    additional generation is needed by next summer, then they will follow
    through with the utilities proposal.

  subject: TFA-Houston Computer Needs
  text: |-
    Hello!  Will and I decided this would be a good way to ask for assistance
    from the TFA national board members residing in Houston. TFA-H is enjoying
    incredible momentum right now--so much so that we are once again in dire
    need of computers. We have made contact with several companies and have some
    corporate proposals under consideration, but those are "down the road"
    relationships assuming they work out as planned.   Please reach out to
    anyone and everyone to make them aware of TFA-Houston and how much the
    contribution of retired computers means to the disadvantaged neighborhoods
    and schools that we serve.  We have a request in to Exxon Mobil Upstream
    Research as I understand Exxon is replacing 40K desktops with laptops.  I
    haven't been able to make headway with Exxon Mobil yet--if you can assist
    with trying to obtain their retired computers, that would excellent.  This
    could help our efforts across the country.

    UPDATE:  We have now assisted 74 organizations and have a backlog of demand.
    This Saturday, November 11, we will provide 75 computers to 4 organizations.
    This will deplete our inventory.  We have several partnerships in the making
    that will greatly increase the demand for our services. This week I also
    participated in a meeting headed by the Mayor's office to bring the
    technology and economic providers of the Enhanced Enterprise Community
    together to see how we can effectively collaborate.  Judging by the interest
    of my post-meeting conversations, this will also generate considerable
    demand for our services.  We want to be able to deliver what we say we can
    since we are now moving to the forefront of digital divide efforts in
    Houston.

    Thank you for your commitment and willingness to serve the cause of
    eliminating the digital divide in Houston!   We are making a difference in
    the lives of thousands of children and their families--let's keep moving
    forward. I have attached an information sheet that you can use if you need
    it as well as a list of the equipment we can use.   I have also included an
    update of the progress of TFA-Houston.  Please email or call if you have
    questions.

  subject: 'e-Katz: Chief Kroeker'
  text: |
    Over the past week I have heard from many thoughtful and concerned citizens
    about their opinions on Chief Kroeker.  About an hour ago, I held a news
    conference to release the statement below in response.  I wanted to make
    sure you were able to read it in its entirety.

    You are a part of my e-Katz list because of your work with me or my
    administration.  To be removed from the "e-Katz" distribution list, simply
    reply to this e-mail with your request.  If you have multiple e-mail
    addresses you use, please include a name and/or company, otherwise we may
    not be able to locate the correct entry to remove.  For more information on
    the Katz administration, visit our website at
    http://www.ci.portland.or.us/mayor.


    Statement Regarding Police Chief Mark Kroeker

    "I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously.  I have
    reviewed this situation with care.  I want to thank those who provided me
    feedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.

    "The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests
    with me.  I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the
    taped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no
    way reflect my own personal beliefs.

    "My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails and
    transcripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on this
    issue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious
    views from his professional conduct?

    "I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue
    to do so. His performance has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau
    in a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.  He is moving our law
    enforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.  Therefore, I
    have asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.  He has my strong
    support to continue.

    "The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal
    religious views.  I have a responsibility to review their employment status
    if their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their ability
    to perform their professional responsibilities.

    "Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he
    is "out of step with Portland" could be used in other Oregon communities to
    fire more liberal public officials who are "out of step" with their
    community's conservative majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both
    ways.

    "Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He
    assures me he is prepared to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo
    the damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, than
    just walk away.

    "He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who
    are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff.
    He has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so.

    "He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of
    all Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.

    "He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokesperson
    to educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a "gay disease."

    "He will continue to seek advice from the City Council, the Bureau's Sexual
    Minority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.

    "He agrees to take all this on with all his heart.

    "In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience.  I will
    work to turn this negative situation into a positive one: to expand our
    sense of tolerance; to promote the notion that regardless of a person's
    personal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective public servant; and
    to deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.

    "As Mayor, I will do my part and more.  I hope you will join me."

    for meeting with Bob and I last week.\nHow ironic to find you working with one
    of my \ngraduate school classmates, Gene Humphrey.\n\nAs we discussed, Vanguard
    is interested in exploring\nwhat kinds of opportunities may exist for venture
    \ninvestment in the energy arena.  We think that\nthe ultimate \"internet (and
    everything) infrastructure\" play is about clean,\nalways on, electrical power.
    \ While we are not experts in the area,\nand are not yet certain it will be a
    productive area for venture\ncapital investment of the type Vanguard does, we
    feel \nthat there is a sufficient market need in multiple segments that \nthere
    MAY be such an investment opportunity which it\nwould make sense for us to pursue
    as an investment\nfocus area.  This could have value for Enron should\nwe determine
    investment areas which are symbiotic\nwith Enron and which we could collaborate
    on, as we\nhelp catalyze/create/fund exciting new companies.\n\nAs we discussed
    we would love to participate in a brainstorming and \nperspective setting session
    with visionary and strategic Enron executives\nwho\nhave domain knowledge and
    an interest. Our potential interest areas span \nfrom generation (alternatives,
    distributed, and conventional) \nto transmission to distribution to storage...fixed

    Compaq's committee and board meeting schedule for 2001 is set out in the
    attached document. We've basically kept the same schedule except for
    October. Michael Capellas is joining the Business Council, which will meet
    during our former time for the October meeting. All directors but one were
    available the third week in October.

    We're still trying to improve attendance for the two-day strategy meeting in
    the summer. Please send us your availability for June 27-28 or June 28-29.
    If we move to June, the July meeting would be one day only--July 26.

    In addition, we would like to claim dates for our 2002 Board meetings as
    most of your calendars are very busy and tend to fill up fast. In the past
    our Board meetings have been on the fourth Thursday of the first and third
    month of the quarter, and the December meeting is usually held on the second
    Thursday. Please review the dates on page 2 of the attached file and get

  subject: Board Metting Dates
  text: "Mike has suggested that we cut back  board meetings to fewer than the eight
    \n(8) we currently hold.? In order to  give you some background, Linda checked
    \nother peer companies and the meetings  range from 6 to 8 a year.? \n?\nI think
    that we can cut back to 6,  however it may be more prudent to drop to \n7 this
    year and first see how it goes  .? The two meetings that can be \ndropped most
    easily are June or  September.? \n?\nJune,  because we have the two day strat
    \ plan meeting in July, and Sept. \nbecause we don't yet have 4th quarter results
    \ and not a lot of new \ninformation is available.\n?\nI think that the board
    meetings take up   an incredible amount of Compaq \nexecutive time and energy.
    I would rather have  them concentrate on getting 6 \nor 7 meetings right, getting
    the company back on  track and? increasing \nearnings.? So, my vote is to?recommend
    to the board that we  eliminate the \nSeptember '01 meeting.? That is a particularly
    busy month for  many people as \nexhibited by the lack of attendance we had at
    this past September  meeting (5 \nmembers).? In looking back, we seem to be able
    to \"fill the  house\" in June.\n?\nOn the other hand, you all may want to  continue
    with the number of meetings \nwe currently have.? I will await your  reply.\n?\nRegards,\n?\n?"

    Estate Company




    Dear Gil:

    Thank you for requesting information regarding my business.  First I am
    pleased to be a new member of the US-Mexico Chamber of Commerce and look
    forward to meeting you and the members.

    I am an independent Real Estate Broker under my own name Paula A. McGowan
    and
    a CIPS (Certified International Property Specialist) located in Colorado
    Springs, Colorado.  I have been active in Colorado Real Estate for the past
    seven years and marketing Mexico property and assisting US/International
    buyers since 1995.

    The main purpose of my business is to assist inbound or outbound individuals
    or companies who plan to invest or relocate to another country.  This
    includes working with international professionals such as real estate
    practitioners, attorneys, accountants, lenders or developers on their
    behalf.
     I will assist companies wishing to locate production facilities in
    Colorado,
    Internationally or in Mexico such as the state of Sonora and will inquire
    about government incentives to companies willing to relocate.  I also make
    referrals to real estate practitioners and professionals in other countries.

    I am a member of FIABCI, (The International Real Estate Federation) based in
    France which provides me direct access to international real estate contacts
    and professionals in over 55 countries throughout the world.  I am also a
    member of The National Association of Realtors International, CIPS Network
    which is a resource of hundreds of real estate practitioners who specialize
    in international property practices throughout the globe. These
    organizations
    provide our members an avenue where we can market property for clients at
    marketing sessions held during US and International conventions.  In
    Colorado
    I am a member of the Colorado Association of Realtors, the Pikes Peak
    Association of Realtors and a member of the Broadmoor Golf Club.

    When my parents moved to Mexico in the late 50's, my love of Mexico began.
    I
    made many trips to visit them, have close friends of 20 years in the Guaymas
    area and know many of the business people.  My husband and I reside in San
    Carlos, Sonora, Mexico part time.  We have been active in Mexico Senior Golf
    Tournaments in Acapulco, Guadalajara and San Carlos during the past 14
    years.
     We are past members of the Asociacion Mexicana A.C. De Golf Senior, the San
    Carlos Country Club/Club de Golf de Guaymas and I am a member of Los
    Recuerdos, a women's organization in San Carlos.

    I presently market property in Guaymas, Sonora, Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, a
    home in Guadalajara and a 320 acre ranch in Valle De Bravo, Mexico.  These
    properties can be seen on my website at <A
    HREF="http://www.paulamcgowan.com">
    www.paulamcgowan.com</A>.

    Please feel free to contact me if I can be of help to you or the members.

    Dear Ken,

    First off, I have a friend who is setting up a plant in Corcoran,
    Northern Calif., to manufacture a welded reinforcement grid building
    building structural systems.  They will need 480V/1200 amp. service.  I
    suggested that they would be better off making an electricity provision
    agreement with you rather than PG&E.

    His name is Hans Bauman.  He can be reached at 949-640 2880.  Please
    have your people contact him ASAP as he plans to open for business in
    November.

    Next, the Aspen Accord conference in Sweden went extraordinarily well
    ... especially with the California issues in such abound.  Commissioner
    Wood was there along with the mayors etc. of the cities.  I know that
    there is a business opportunity that can be developed and would be
    pleased, when the timing is right to discuss this with you.  After all
    Ken, your California experience should show that improvement in your
    position in the marketplace could be better.

    Why not, on your next trip to Aspen, give me a call and drop by Orange
    County airport and I'll ride up with you.  We can talk about what I see
    as lost opportunities and how to capture them.

    My new life is going amazingly well.  I'm working in an advisory
    capacity in California, Chicago and Sweden ... and taking time to 'smell
    the roses'.  Hope you are doing the same.

    Best regards,

    John

    Dear Family,
    Heather and I were talking about NYC and thought we
    should make some reservations for dinner for the
    entire family on Friday and Saturday night. I am
    trying to get reservations for the entire family at Le
    Cirque 2000 for Friday night at 7:30 but we will be
    very lucky to get in. Does anyone have other
    suggestions or an objection to Le Cirque? I am
    attaching a review of the restaurant. It is definitely
    a little "Haute" but I've heard it is also a lot of
    fun. Heather is looking into Italian restaurants for
    Saturday night, as well.

    This is just a suggestion but we were worried that we
    may have difficutly getting into a good restaurant if
    we wait too long. Also, I think I am just a little
    excited about the trip!

    The Verdict
    The highest of the city's high-society restaurants.

    Tip Sheet
    One of New York's Best
    Nominated for best dessert and for best French
    restaurant, this aptly-named restaurant provides the
    city's most carnivalesque dinner experience.
    Can't Wait?
    Peruse Le Cirque 2000's blockbuster wine list now.

    Also Nominated for Best French Restaurant
    Daniel, Chanterelle, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin

    Also Nominated for Best Dessert
    Gramercy Tavern, Payard Patisserie, Jean Georges, Park
    Avenue Cafe

    The Scene
    Uber-designer Adam Tihany's (Jean Georges, among
    others) surreal interior evokes simultaneous thoughts
    of the Sistine Chapel and "The Jetsons." Purple,
    one-armed velvet chairs, neon tubing and
    stainless-steel sculptures compete for attention with
    the soaring, gilded ceilings, pre-Raphaelite murals
    and bejeweled patrons. Ringleader Sirio Maccioni
    oversees a front-of-house that has won praise for
    softening the haughty edge that marked the
    restaurant's pre-Y2K incarnation.

    The Food
    Still some of the most sublime haute cuisine around.
    Though longtime sous chef Sotta Kuhnn is now heading
    the kitchen=01*having succeeded Sylvain Portay (who took
    over for Daniel Boulud)=01*the luxurious,
    truffle-and-foie-gras-studded fare remains as sharp as
    ever. The current menu includes the long-running
    paupiette of sea bass with Barolo sauce and leeks, as
    well a sauteed veal chop with bacon-wrapped asparagus.
    Patrons can take decision-making out of the picture
    entirely with the five-course chef's degustation menu,
    a bargain at $90.

  subject: 'The Governors'' Natural Gas Summit: Responding to the Challenge'
  text: "Dr. Kenneth L. Lay \nChairman & C.E.O. \nEnron Corporation \n\nDear Dr. Lay:
    \n\nI am writing to bring your attention to an important and timely event that
    \nwill be held on September 20th at the Hyatt Regency Columbus, in Columbus, \nOhio
    - \"The Governors' Natural Gas Summit: Responding to the Challenge.\" This \nevent
    is convened by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC).? \nCo-chaired
    by Alaska Governor Tony Knowles, IOGCC Chairman and Ohio Governor \nBob Taft,
    with the participation of other governors, this forum promises to \nbe an outstanding
    exchange of ideas among leaders of government, energy \nproducers, transporters,
    distributors, and end-users on the subject of the \ncurrent and long-term outlook
    for natural gas resources and markets in North \nAmerica. A very distinguished
    group of speakers is assembling, including \nsenior government officials and senior
    executives of companies critically \ninvolved in the energy value chain.\n\nPrimary
    Goals of the Summit include: \n\n* Exploring and clearly communicating the current
    dynamics of the natural gas \nmarket \n* Informing the industry and the public
    about the current and future supply \npotential for gas \n* Providing governmental
    and industry leaders with an opportunity to discuss \nnatural gas in the context
    of national energy policy, with the input of \ninterested State Governors.\n\nThe
    Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) and the governors have \nasked
    CERA to help organize the Summit and has invited senior CERA staff to \nmoderate
    panel discussions on the Natural Gas Marketplace and the Supply \nResponse for
    North America. In addition, I will be providing an opening \nframework for participants
    and contributing to the wrap-up of the Summit at \nthe close of the day with the
    governors.? We are very pleased to be working \nwith the governors and with the
    IOGCC and its executive director, Christine \nHansen.\n\nWe hope that you can
    join us for this important event, and encourage you to \nview the Summit agenda
    on the IOGCC Web-site at: \nhttp://www.iogcc.state.ok.us/MEETINGS/2000_Governors_Natural_Gas_Summit.htm?
    \n\nOn this site, you will also find complete registration information including
    \nfees, registration form, and logistics. \n\nYou may also be interested in a
    recent Washington Post article on volatility \nin the gas and power markets, which
    helps provide a context for the \ndiscussion and which was co-authored by CERA
    Managing Director Tom Robinson \nand myself. This article may be found on the
    Washington Post Web-site at: \nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18653-2000Jul20.html
    \n\nShould you have any questions regarding the Summit or CERA's participation,
    \nplease contact my colleague Ron Kapavik at +1 936 931 1416 or via e-mail to
    \nrkapavik@cera.com.\n\nSincerely, \n\nDan Yergin \nChairman, Cambridge Energy

    that this paper includes the Executive Summary, a copy of which I sent

  text: "E-Mail to:   Friends and Associates        URGENT\nFrom:         Lou Cordia\nDate:
    \        November 13, 2000\nRe:            President Bush or President Gore?\n\nGovernor
    Bush and Secretary Cheney won on election night by getting\nmore votes in Florida
    than Gore/Lieberman.\n\nGovernor Bush and Secretary Cheney won when the election
    night vote\nwas confirmed by an official recount in Florida.\n\nThe only legitimate
    remaining ballots to be counted are those from Floridians\nwho reside overseas,
    who post-marked their ballots on or before November 7th,\nand whose ballots are
    received on or before November 17th.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that Gore/Lieberman
    are trying to steal the election.\nLike the Clinton/Gore's years of public relations
    and legal distortions, \nGore/Lieberman\nare looking for a \"governing legal authority\"
    to increase their probability \nof victory.\nThey want four counties in Florida
    where Democrats significantly out-register \nRepublicans\nto hand-count their
    ballots; and let the Democrats in charge of the recounts \n\"objectively\"\ndecide
    what was in the mind of the voter when he/she did not completely punch \nthe ballot.\nFor
    example, if someone partially punched a hole in a ballot because he/she \nstarted
    to vote\nfor Gore and then decided in the booth not to vote him or anyone, these
    \nDemocrats would\ngive the vote to Gore - that's according to the second set
    of rules, as \nchanged during the\nrecount in Palm Beach County.  Incidently,
    but not surprisingly, all three of \nthese Palm\nBeach officials are Democrats.\n\nWhat
    Gore/Lieberman Campaign Chairman Richard Daley is orchestrating is as \noutrageous\nas
    what his father did in 1960 in Cook County Illinois in stealing the \nelection
    from John Kennedy.\n\nPoint blank, Al Gore is not as honorable as Richard Nixon
    was in 1960 and \nGerald Ford was\nin 1976 when both Republican candidates conceded
    the close elections despite \ncampaign\nadvisors' requests for recounts.  They
    put the interests of the country ahead \nof their own\npersonal interest in the
    White House.  They knew then that recounting ad \ninfinitum would\nproduce pluses
    and minuses in vote counts; but they trusted that the votes \nwould balance\nout
    if all precincts were recounted.  They believed in the integrity of our \nelections,
    and knew\nof the adverse consequences here and abroad of second-guessing our election
    \nprocess.\n\nIf you are as upset as I am, then please help by making a contribution
    to the \nBush/Cheney\nRecount Fund that has been set up to fight the Gore/Lieberman
    trial lawyers \nand public\nrelations spin- miesters.\n\nI am enclosing an admittedly
    less emotionally-charged letter from Bush/Cheney \nCampaign\nChairman Don Evans
    and a response form.  Please HELP TODAY.\n\n______________________________________________\n\nTo:

    one more time on behalf of Governor \nBush\nand Secretary Cheney.\n\nIt is now
    clear we must have the funding necessary to fight this legal battle \nin Florida.\nGovernor
    Bush won on Election Day, a victory confirmed by a recount.  Now, \nthe other\nside
    is seeking yet a third count by hand.\n\nThe law allows us to open a \"recount
    fund\" which we have done this morning.  \nThis\nexpensive legal process must
    be funded immediately.  We need you to overnight \na check\nfor $5000, made payable

    check must come from personal funds.  No corporate contributions are \nallowed.\nThe
    contribution does not count against your annual federal giving limit of \n$25,000.\nWe
    are not required to make these donations public.  However, in keeping with \nGovernor\nBush's
    \"full disclosure\" policy on financial contributions, these \ncontributions will
    be posted\non the Bush-Cheney website.\n\nWe respectfully ask that you limit the
    amount of your check to $5000.  Should \nwe have\nfunds left over, we will refund

    Dear Governing Board member,

    On behalf of Rajat Gupta, Chairman of the Indian School of Business (ISB),
    I am writing to invite you to an informal meeting of the ISB on Sunday
    January 28, 2001 from 1000AM to 1200Noon at the Belvedere Hotel in Davos,
    Switzerland. This date and location coincides with the World Economic Forum
    meeting in Davos. We know that several of you will be at Davos, and we
    would like to take this opportunity to have an informal meeting like we did
    earlier this year. Based on feedback from the last meeting, we have limited
    the meeting to two hours only. I do hope you will join us if you are going
    to be in Davos. We will send out a detailed note on the agenda and
    logistics once we hear back from you.

    With thanks and best regards,

    Pramath Sinha
    CEO, ISB

    Subject:  Informal ISB Governing Board meeting in Davos, Switzerland during
          World Economic Forum


    Dear Governing Board member,

    On behalf of Rajat Gupta, Chairman of the Indian School of Business (ISB),
    I am writing to invite you to an informal meeting of the ISB on Sunday
    January 28, 2001 from 1000AM to 1200Noon at the Belvedere Hotel in Davos,
    Switzerland. This date and location coincides with the World Economic Forum
    meeting in Davos. We know that several of you will be at Davos, and we
    would like to take this opportunity to have an informal meeting like we did
    earlier this year. Based on feedback from the last meeting, we have limited
    the meeting to two hours only. I do hope you will join us if you are going
    to be in Davos. We will send out a detailed note on the agenda and
    logistics once we hear back from you.

    With thanks and best regards,

    Pramath Sinha
    CEO, ISB

    ******E-NEWS THIS WEEK*******

    KVAERNER WINS BALAL AWARD
    Tehran - Kvaerner Singapore, part of the Anglo-Norwegian group, has been
    appointed detailed engineering contractor for the offshore production
    platform in the Balal oil field, being developed by TotalFinaElf. The award
    follows Iranian Offshore Engineering and Construction (OIEC) and Singapore's
    SembCorp winning the $60m contract for installation of the platform to
    process 40,000bbl/d of oil and 14mcfd of associated gas.
    The Anglo-Norwegian group was brought in by NIOC subsidiary Petro Pars in
    April to manage the first phase development of South Pars gas field. In a
    separate development, OIEC and Petro Iran are reported to be looking for a
    foreign partner to take a 30% stake in the $850m Salman offshore project,
    which the two Iranian companies won in October on a buy-back basis. The
    Salman contract, tendered in 1998, requires the rebuilding of war-damaged
    facilities and upgrading production at the field by 45,000 bbl/d to 130,000
    bbl/d as well as developing an associated gas structure. http://www.irna.com


    OPEC TO SUSPEND 20-DAY MECHANISM UNTIL JANUARY
    Vienna - OPEC exporters have rejected calls from consuming nations for
    further extra crude supplies that would have helped ease stubbornly high
    world oil prices and cut fuel bills this winter. It appears, as the
    Ministers meet in Austria this month, that OPEC will not be adding further
    increases to world supplies despite oil prices remaining outside its
    automatic 20-day production increase mechanism, set at $22-28/bbl. 'There
    will be no increases this year under any circumstances,' Indonesian Oil
    Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro told awaiting reporters after a two-hour
    meeting ahead of the formal ratification of the decision.

    SUDAN SIGN EXPLORATION AGREEMENT
    Khartoum - Sudan has signed an oil exploration agreement with several local
    and international companies for an area in central Sudan, the
    government-owned Al-Anbaa newspaper reported on Sunday. 'Sudan has signed a
    production agreement...covering prospecting, development and transportation
    of oil with Gulf oil companies, the Chinese National Petroleum Corp, Al Than
    and Sudapet,' the daily said.
    Al-Anbaa said the agreement covered a 75sq.km area on the western bank of
    the White Nile, south of the town of Rabak, about 275km south of Khartoum.
    The Gulf companies hold a 46% stake in the investment, the Chinese company
    has 23%, Al Than also has 23% and Sudapet holds 8%.
    Sudan, which produces about 185,000 barrels per day of crude oil, began
    crude exports in August 1999. It had previously been importing oil and oil
    products for about $300m a year, eating up most of its export earnings. It
    has also been reported this week that Talisman Energy are to step up their
    exploration efforts in the country, despite opposition from humanitarian
    groups.


    SHELL INK EGYPTIAN GTL AGREEMENT
    Cairo - Royal Dutch/Shell Group confirmed this week that they are to invest
    $1.7bn in an Egyptian gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant that could lead the country
    to use domestic gas reserves to satisfy its entire oil products market for
    more than 50 years.
    Egypt is currently an importer of oil products. The oil giant agreed to
    initial terms on the deal early in October. Shell said it has now signed a
    development protocol with Egyptian General Petroleum for a
    75,000-barrel-per-day GTL conversion plant to convert natural gas into
    synthetic fuels. Crucially the project is now said to have the backing of
    Egyptian Petroleum Minister Sameh Fahmy. Production could be in place by
    late 2005, while a plant at the same site producing liquefied natural gas
    (LNG) could be up and running earlier, by mid-2004.

    of the largest Houston corporations would include (Compaq Computer, American
    General, BMC Software, Conoco, Sysco, Waste Management, Coastal, Houston
    Industries, Baker Hughes, Shell Oil), but we can discuss this once we've
    outlined the objectives of such a regional meeting to promote the case for
    corporate philanthropy. Chuck Lee (Verizon) is planning to host a similar

    IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY\nNovember 2000, Number 11\n\n\nCRITICAL ASPECTS
    OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY\nSidney Weintraub\n\nWhen the word \"globalization\" is
    uttered, it evokes two contradictory \nvisceral reactions: it is either the essential
    element of recent U.S. \ncompetitiveness; or it is inherently evil because the
    global spread of \nmultinational corporations enriches the wealthy and economically
    powerful at \nthe expense of the vast multitude of workers. In what follows, I
    will avoid \nboth attacks and praise, and instead focus on key features of international
    \ntrade and investment that characterize what is taking place in much of the \nworld.\n\nA
    country, if its dictatorial leader so insists, can set its own prohibitive \ntariff
    and import structure and reject foreign investment. North Korea and \nVietnam,
    both nondemocratic, did this for many years, despite the horrible \ncost this
    policy imposed on national welfare. This isolation is breaking down \nin these
    two countries, even as it did earlier in China after the death of \nMao, and for
    much the same reason. Eternal poverty is not a good formula for \nregime continuity.\n\nGuarding
    economic sovereignty did not take the same absolutist form in most \nother countries,
    but a profound transformation is taking place in them as \nwell. Import barriers
    are coming down and attacks against foreign investment \nare being transmuted
    into searches to attract foreign investment. Mexico, \nbefore its debt collapse
    in 1982, favored external borrowing over investment \nto obtain foreign exchange,
    but learned to its dismay that this practice \ncontained its own risks when the
    debt could not be serviced. The philosophic \nbase of development then changed
    and foreign investment was actively sought \nas an essential requirement for Mexico
    to augment its exports. This outlook \nwas the premise of NAFTA. Hugo Ch?vez,
    the president of Venezuela, rails \nagainst primitive neoliberalism (neoliberalismo
    salvaje), but nevertheless \nhas kept the country's import tariffs relatively
    low, even as he makes a \ngreat effort to obtain foreign direct investment to
    develop his country's \ntelecommunications and natural gas activities. Ch?vez,
    so far, has shown a \ntendency to talk like a Marxist, much like Fidel Castro,
    his romantic icon, \nbut then act like a capitalist.\n\nFor many of the world's
    poorest countries, the primordial problem is not the \nspread of multinational
    corporations, but their inability to participate in \nthe process. This is especially
    true in sub-Saharan Africa. Their poverty, \nsmall internal markets, and accompanying
    political instability make them poor \ndestinations for foreign investment, other
    than to exploit minerals for \nexport. This does not lead to substantial job creation.\n\nBoth
    foreign direct investment and international trade are growing more \nrapidly than
    world economic growth. This is a clear manifestation that the \n\"foreign\" aspect
    of the world economy is becoming increasingly important. If \none looks back only
    20 years, when the dominant economic model in Latin \nAmerica was to develop behind
    high import barriers and to downplay the \nimportance of exports, it is startling
    how much development thinking has \nchanged in that part of the world. East Asia,
    with its export orientation, \nbecame the model, and not the preachings of those
    who advised Latin America \nto look inward.\n\nThe bulk of the world's trade is
    carried on by large corporations. This is \nnot a new phenomenon. These same corporations
    are large investors in foreign \nmanufacturing and service activities. Indeed,
    the two phenomena-investing and \nproducing in foreign countries and then selling
    much of the output in still \nother foreign countries, as well as the home market-are
    inseparable.\n\nInternational trade is increasingly taking place in intermediate
    rather than \nfinal products-chips for computers, parts for office machinery,
    engines for \nautomobiles and trucks, cotton and wool fabrics for apparel. Look
    under the \nhood of your car; the transmission assembly may have elements produced
    in a \nnumber of countries. The assembly line in Detroit works on a just-in-time
    \nbasis to receive the material needed from across the border in Windsor, \nOntario-and
    beware of a slowdown from a customs snafu that leads to a costly \ndisruption
    in the manufacturing process.\n\nThis goes by the name coproduction. The parts
    are produced in a variety of \nlocations, assembled in other places, and sold
    globally. Much of the sales \nare within the same multinational corporation, say,
    from a parent to a \nsubsidiary (intra-firm trade), or within the same sector
    (intra-industry \ntrade). As goods pass across borders in this fashion, the absence
    of border \nimpediments (tariffs, lengthy inspection delays) is crucial, as the
    \nautomotive example between Windsor and Detroit exemplifies. Hence, the drive
    \nfor trade negotiations to lower these barriers and the proliferation of \nregional
    economic integration agreements, such as NAFTA, to legally ensure \nthe absence
    of delays in a just-in-time world.\n\nEconomic integration and, by extension,
    the process of globalization, is \ncentered on competition in particular sectors
    when it comes to production and \nmerchandise trade. What is taking place is a
    form of division of labor-Adam \nSmith on a regional and global scale. The global
    aspect is made possible by \ntechnology, advances in communication and transportation,
    and by financing \nfar more vast than anything seen before. Corporations take
    many factors into \naccount when setting up complementary plants in foreign countries,
    such as \nsize of the domestic market, the availability and price of labor, the
    cost of \ntransportation, and the political stability of the country where the
    \ninvestment is made. The growth of U.S. coproduction with Mexico was based \nprimarily
    on two considerations: proximity, and thus low transportation \ncosts; and inexpensive
    labor. Most foreign direct investment is made among \nindustrial countries, which
    is evidence that cheap labor is by no means \nalways the dominant criterion. This
    is evident as well from the paucity of \ninvestment in the world's poorest countries.\n\nIf
    most international trade is conducted by large corporations, what does \nthis
    imply for the future of small and medium-sized enterprises? In just \nabout all
    countries, goods and services that are not internationally traded \nare more voluminous
    than tradables. In addition, many large corporations have \nconcluded that making
    all inputs in-house is not the most efficient practice \nand instead are subcontracting
    to independent producers and service \nproviders-and many of these are relatively
    small enterprises. Their products \nare then exported indirectly, via the exports
    of the large corporations.\n\nThere is no intent in this discussion to assert
    that multinational \ncorporations invariably provide their workers with optimal
    working conditions \nand good salaries and are always careful to avoid environmental
    degradation \nin their operations. We know that many corporations are not that
    meticulous, \neven though we also know that wages and working conditions in foreign
    \ntransplants generally are superior to those of domestic enterprises. We know
    \nthat foreign trade and investment results in losers in the home countries, \nalthough
    by now it is clear that there are many more winners. We know that \nthe global
    spread of business benefits some countries more than others and \nthat some regions
    of countries prosper while others lag behind. The \nglobalization genie-in the
    form of investment, trade, financial flows, and \ntechnology advances-is out of
    the bottle. The challenges are to minimize the \ndownside dangers while exploiting
    the upside benefits that globalization can \noffer to countries throughout the
    world.\n\n\nIssues in International Political Economy is published by the William

    GET YOUR GEOGRAPHY RIGHT!
    Jakarta relocated to Washington, D.C.? Singapore
    reunited with Malaysia?

    We offer these and other geographical miscues in our
    lament that, even in the era of globalization, geographic
    education just ain't what it used to be.

    VIRTUAL SOVEREIGNTY FOR JERUSALEM
    If you start from the assumption that, one day, Israel and
    Palestine have to learn to live with each other, can the

    Forwarded by Joseph W Sutton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on \n09/01/2000 09:13 AM ---------------------------\n
    \  \n\tEnron International\n\t\n\tFrom:  John Hardy                           08/31/2000
    03:57 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Joseph W Sutton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\ncc:  \nSubject:
    Azurix and OPIC\n\nJoe\n I want to give you a heads up on a serious issue that
    has developed between \nAzurix and OPIC. There is no action requested from you
    but I wanted you to be \naware of this development.\n\n Last spring we encouraged
    Azurix to look to OPIC and IDB for funding support \nfor the financing needed
    for their Argentinian concession for the province of \nBuenos Aires.  For the
    past several months teams from Azurix and the two \nlending agencies have been
    moving forward with the expectation that we could \ngo to an OPIC Board vote in
    September for $100 million and to the IDB Board \nin October for $150 million.\n\n
    Everything was going along great until last friday.  Early last week OPIC \nhad
    its credit committee review and approve the project, though apparently \nsome
    members were concerned about the regulatory risk associated with water \nprojects.
    (This would be OPIC's first financing of a water project.)   Friday \nAM, George
    Munoz recieved a draft cable from the US Embassy in Argentina \nproviding their
    assessment of the project and, on the spot, pulled the \nproject from Investment
    Committee and off the calendar for consideration by \nthe OPIC Board in September.
    \ Friday afternoon, OPIC staff informed Azurix \nand our office in a meeting that
    Azurix should be resorting to \"Plan B\", \nimplying that the project would not
    go forward in the foreseeable future.  \nOPIC would not provide Azurix or us with
    the cable. \n\n Over the weekend, the cable was formally sent to Washington, though
    now \nreclassified as a classified document so we have not been able to see its
    \ncontents.  Moreover, the Ambassador has specifically conveyed his directive
    \nto Washington that the cable is not to be shown to anyone outside of the \ngovernment,
    \  John Garrison has a relationship with the Ambassador but has \nnot been able
    to get the Embassy to alter its position, nor would I think \nthey be inclined
    to do so now given the fact that they could have \ndisassociated themselves from
    the draft on friday but did not.\n\n On the positive side, the InterAmerican Development
    Bank has stated that \nthey are prepared to consider increasing the size of the
    B loan to cover the \nadditional $100 million.   We have met with the IDB and
    discussed the \nsituation at OPIC; they seem satisfied at this point.\n\n It appears
    to me that George Munoz is unwilling to take to the Board the \nAzurix project
    when a damning cable has been circulated around the government \neven if the substance
    of the cable is exaggerated, taken out of context and \ndistorted.  From what
    we have learned, the cable containes concerns expressed \nabout the regulatroy
    framework, labor issues etc., etc., but also comments \nfrom the Argentinian goverment
    about Azurix and the concession about Bahia \nBlanca and the politics of Azurix
    in Argentina. It is uncompromisingly \nnegative in its tone.\n\n Azurix is seeking
    a return of  the $250,000 fee and will withdraw its \napplication.\n\n Hope all
    is well.  John\n\n\n\n       \n"

  subject: US Chamber
  text: "You had asked for my input on a response to a letter you received from Tom
    \nDonahue regarding increasing Enron's contribution to the US Chamber to \n$100,000.
    \ I have been giving the Chamber a bit of a hard time lately and \nwanted you
    to know why.\n\nI have been in touch with both Tom and his staff over the last
    year.  Donahue \nhas done a very good job raising money and getting his membership
    rolls up, \nboth in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member.  My
    \nreservation about the Chamber is that they won't take a stand on something \nwhich
    is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it \nwill
    alienate a vocal few.  Electric restructuring was a key example of \nthis.  There
    was no doubt where they should have been on the issue, but \ninstead of embracing
    retail open access legislation at the federal level they \ndecided to have a \"process\".
    \ Naturally, all the utilities volunteered to \nparticipate in the process and
    outnumbered the nonutility members when it \ncame time to vote.  The vote supported
    wholesale, but not retail, reform \n(with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded
    cost recovery).  Afterwards, the \nfederal debate shifted solely to wholesale
    legislation (though this is not \nexclusively the Chamber's fault).\n\nUnfortunately,
    Tom's forceful and competitive approach when it comes to \nraising his membership
    rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a \nfew members will be upset.
    \ For Enron it's a bit like paying $100,000 for a \nveto right.  The only things
    the organization pushes for are the things \neveryone agrees on in the business
    community -- eg China PNTR and lower \ncorporate taxes -- things they will push
    for whether we pay dues or not (and \nthings we will add our separate voice to
    in any event).  \n\nAs I have explained to the Chamber, Enron makes its money
    challenging \nconventional wisdom, changing the way markets work, and dislocating
    \nincumbents.  Anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some
    \nmembers of the business community and the Chamber is unlikely to stand with
    \nus.  They represent the status quo in the business community.  Tom is an \nextremely
    promising leader; he needs to create a new kind of voice for the \nbusiness community.
    \ A voice which stands for moving business to the next \nlevel, not just protecting
    its current position.\n\nHaving said all that, the Chamber (particularly its international
    chapters) \nhas been useful to us in the past.  In previous years, Donahue himself
    has \nintervened on our behalf with Latin American leaders.  As a consequence,
    I \nhave asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain Chamber members
    \nat a lower dues (and policy participation) level, but with continuing access
    \nto their international activities.  I suggested something in the $25,000 \nrange.
    \ That's why they are approaching you (they want us to double our \ncurrent dues
    to $100,000).\n\nCurrently, I am inclined to just withdraw from Chamber membership,
    but I plan \nto defer to Linda Robertson.  I am interested in your insights, or,
    if you \nprefer, you can simply refer them to Linda or me."

    N5737 Ken Lay's phone\n\nGary, \nLeast I forget!  On N5737 the other day (11/18)
    Mr. Lay reported to Bill \nReddick that when his phone (#2 R/H seat) rings and
    he answers that it \ndisconnects on him.  He told Bill that this is the third
    time he has reported \nthis problem.  I spoke personally with Bill about this.
    \ We checked and there \nis no record of this problem reported recently (we checked
    back to May 2000) \non all three Falcon 900's.\n\nLyndel checked the system and
    there does seem to be a problem with it \ndisconnecting if you pick it up before
    the third ring.  After the third ring \nit works fine.  That is all I know at
    this time.  Garrett Av is coming over \ntoday to check the system.\n\nI know you
    don't like emails but I didn't want this it slip by.  I've \ndiscussed this with
    Ron and John as well.\n\nKeith"

  subject: Argentine devaluation exposure
  text: "Attached is an analysis of the probability of a devaluation in Argentina
    and \nthe contractual protections TGS has in the event of a devaluation.  \n\nLong
    and short of it is - \n\nArgentina's economy is primarily dollarized and it would
    appear that a \ndevaluation would do considerable short term harm to the economy.
    \n\nConvertibility Law was enacted in 1991.  Large part of the population \nremembers
    the super inflation of 1989 and 1990.\n\nTo devalue the currency, Argentina would
    have to amend the Convertibility Law \n- this requires  approval of the Federal
    Congress.\n\nTGS has numerous layers of protection from a devaluation - in addition
    to the \nConvertibility law, it has protection through its license and regulations.
    \ \nIndeed, as you remembered, the tariff is indexed to the exchange rate.\n\nA
    concern is - to the extent the Government takes action as drastic as \nchanging
    the Convertibility Law to implement a devaluation, and it is willing \nto suffer
    the short term economic and political harm of a devaluation - then \nthere is
    a reasonable chance they would go the extra step and find a way \ndelink the tariffs
    of the privatized regulated companies from the dollar.    \nIn this case Enron
    would have protection under the BIT treaty.\n\nThe impact on Enron's P&L is a
    function of whether or not we use the Peso as \nthe functional currency.  If we
    use the Peso as the functional currency - \nEnron would have a signficant negative
    translation adjustment from a \ndevaluation.  If we use the dollar as the functional
    currency - there would \nbe no impact on our income statement.   I will research
    this further in order \nto ensure we can use the dollar as a our functional currency.\n\n\n\nPete"

    Paul and I met with Frank Savage, President & CEO of Alliance Capital
    Managment International in NY today to see if he might be a good
    prospect for the RFF Board.  Ken Lay arranged the meeting - Ken is on
    the board of Howard University (where Frank is chair) and Frank is on
    the Enron board.  Frank also knows Linda and John Deutch (from the
    Council on Foreign Relations.)

    We had a very good meeting - brought him upto speed on RFF and how we
    are trying to expand our visability,esp in NY and in the financial
    community, through events, the Council, etc.  Frank was very receptive
    to our plans, thought we needed to focus on specific topics of interest
    to the financial community and actions we could ask people to help
    with.  He said he would love to come to Dod's breakfast in Feb.and
    learn more about RFF.

    Howard U. is clearly his biggest passion.  We need to send a letter
    from Paul to him documenting previous conversations Paul has had with
    folks at Howard about our fellowship programs and our desire to have
    more African Americans apply.  He will show it to the President and
    encourage him to act on it.)

    Next step: Lesli ask Ken Lay to call Frank, see what he thought of us,
    tell him more about his involvemnt on the Board, and see if Frank might
    want to consider the Board over the next couple of months.

    cc: \n\t\t Subject: \n\n=DJ Enron, Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing\n11/21/0
    15:31 (New York)\n\n\n\n      By Cheryl Devoe Kim\n      Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n\n
    \ TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Canada's Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron\nCanada
    Corp. in Calgary and Powerex Corp. in Vancouver earlier this year as\npart of
    an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two\ncompanies,
    according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires.\n  Bureau investigator
    David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he\nused to gain access to
    the offices that in the summer of 1999, Powerex and\nEnron were coordinating bid
    restatements and inflating the price each received\nfor electricity as they traded
    on the Power Pool of Alberta.\n  The investigation hasn't yet produced any charges
    against either of the\ncompanies, according to Enron. The Competition Bureau declined
    to comment on\nthe status of the case.\n  Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron
    Canada, and Powerex, a unit of\nprovincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power
    Authority (X.BCH), deny\nbreaking any rules or laws.\n  From Powerex's point of
    view, Albertans are looking for someone to blame for\nhigh power prices, which
    have become a political issue in the province.\n  \"They just find it easy to
    blame us for what are pretty fundamental market\ndesign flaws,\" Powerex president
    and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow\nJones Newswires in an interview.\n
    \  Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame\n  The search for someone to
    blame has repeated itself across every \nderegulating\nmarket Enron has participated
    in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.\n  \"Almost every time that either
    power markets or natural gas markets or even\noil markets or gasoline markets
    have experienced any kind of price volatility,\nthere have been investigations
    done,\" Palmer said.\n  Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy
    markets\ninvestigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This
    is the\nfirst such investigation into Powerex's actions, Peterson said.\n  The
    Competition Bureau, based in Ottawa, won't say whether the investigaion\nis ongoing,
    citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.\n  The companies themselves
    said they're not sure of the investigation's \nstatus.\nTheir seized files were
    returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn't heard\nfrom the Bureau since then.
    Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week\nwith a question, according
    to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode.\n  The investigation began when the Power
    Pool of Alberta's system controllers\nnoticed the clearing price for a megawatt
    of electricity was topping C$100 \nwith\nunusual frequency.\n  The Pool's price
    is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power\nfor the following
    day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a bidder could restate the amount\nof power in a bid
    or offer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutes\nbefore the hour of transmission.
    The price paid for every megawatt of power\nneeded by the Pool in a given hour
    is set by the most expensive unit needed to\nmeet demand.\n   Alleged Bid Rigging
    Methods Detailed\n  According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application,
    Powerex and\nEnron were rigging their bids in the following manner:\n  Powerex
    would lower the volume of an existing offer. As little as two \nminutes\nlater,
    Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume,\nbut at
    a \"significantly higher price,\" according to the warrant application.\nSometimes,
    Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its\noffer.\n  Power
    Pool market analyst Owen Craig, who once worked in Enron Canada's gas\ntrading
    group, found that \"as a result of restatements, involving mostly\nPowerex and
    Enron,\" the Pool price was raised once to C$200/MWh, four times to\nbetween C$354.29
    and C$499.93, three times to between C$500 and C$541.63, and\n10 times to between
    C$801.02 and C$998.\n  Based on the restatement patterns, Craig, and then the
    Bureau's Bloom,\nconcluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool. They
    believed the\npower was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then
    offered at the\nhigher price, according to the warrant application. By cutting
    the volume\noffered by Powerex, the more expensive power offered by Enron would
    likely be\nneeded, and every participant would get the higher price.\n  Powerex's
    Peterson doesn't take issue with the trade history as detailed by\nthe Bureau,
    but denies that the company's traders were doing anything wrong or\nthat the two
    companies had some sort of arrangement.\n  \"And we're adamant about that,\" Peterson
    said. \"There was no deal with \nEnron.\nThere was no expectation about what their
    behavior would lead to in terms of a\nchange in prices or anything like that.\"\n
    \ Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cutting the company's\nrisk,
    which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price,\nPeterson
    said.\n  \"Whenever Enron's offer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments
    \nof\nEnron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required,\nPowerex
    would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced\nunit,\"
    according to the warrant application.\n  Peterson's response: \"We're operating
    in a very tight market there and we\nfelt an obligation to make sure the power
    got delivered into Alberta.\"\n  Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules
    or Canadian laws.\n  \"It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower
    than we thought we\ncould sell it at,\" Enron's Thode said. \"And that's what
    Enron and every other\ncompany does that's in the business of trading.\"\n  The
    May 25 search warrant covers the companies' actions between June 1, \n1999,\nand
    Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Pool changed its restatement rules,\nessentially
    closing the loophole, though it did so without ever making public\nits investigation
    into Powerex and Enron.\n  Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discuss
    details of the\ninvestigation.\n  \"Market surveillance is in place to, among
    other things, protect the\ninterests and activities of market participants,\"
    he said.\n  Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-rigging can be fined an
    amount at\nthe court's discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction
    wouldn't\nlikely affect Powerex's ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said.
    In Canada\n\"there would have to have some follow-on action by the Alberta parties
    to\ninhibit that. And so far, they still like to get our power.\"\n  Companies
    Concerned About Reputations\n  The bigger problem, Peterson said, is what the
    case will do to the Powerex\nreputation.\n  \"Essentially both companies are concerned
    about it because we have a lot at\nstake from a reputational point of view,\"
    Peterson said. \"Both companies, I\nbelieve, conduct themselves in the highest
    possible standard. But these are\ndifficult times in the business with prices
    going crazy in Alberta and\nCalifornia and people looking for somebody to blame.
    There's always a\npossibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved.\"\n
    \ Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of\nAlberta
    of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia,\nlinking
    Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Pool market\nsurveillance

  subject: SEC Panel on Investor Information
  text: |-
    Good phone meeting yesterday.  Afterwards, several of you kindly called me
    with additional comments on the issues and procedures.  I also had
    perspective from Nancy Peretsman, who couldn't participate in the call.
    There are some differing views, I know, but let me suggest the following
    next steps.

    First, Tim Koller and I will prepare two things to send around:

    1)  A list of the key issues, together with either (a) a suggested stance
    for the panel on each; or (b) a clear statement of the different approaches
    we could take.

    2)  An elaborated treatment of the "intangibles" issue, together with more
    examples and a shaper definition of a proposed recommendation.

    On the basis of these two papers, we will ask each of you to e-mail or fax
    your comments to me, and I will circulate the entire package of views to
    everyone on the panel.

    Tim and I will then prepare an agenda for a face-to-face meeting for late
    January or early February.  This will give us time to digest the comments,
    talk to one another, etc.  Based on the comments you send me, as well as any
    subsequent discussions we have, we will also be able to prepare another
    draft report for the meeting, no doubt with several bracketed parts that
    will include questions for the group.

    Thanks once again for your energetic participation.

    Best wishes to all for a great Thanksgiving.

  text: |-
    Good morning,

    I am not sure if you are aware of the recent statements by the Prime
    Minister of Canada, on his recent political trip to Whitehorse, Yukon.  He
    made some erroneous statements regarding Canada's position on the ANGTS
    project and Canada's requirements for any project.

    The attached Official Background brief was issued by the PMO (Prime
    Minister's Office) in Ottawa.  As you can see from the brief, Canada does
    not agree that Foothills or the ANGTS project has exclusivity on a project
    for delivering gas from Alaska.  Furthermore, Canada will ensure that any
    project in the north will give maximum economic benefit to northerners.

    I hope you find the attached document informative.  If you have any further
    questions, please feel free to give me a call at your convenience.

    Best regards,

    Bruce

  text: |-
    Dearest Brother and Sister,

    First of all HAPPY THANKSGIVING.  We Talked about you and how improtant our
    family is on several occasions during the last few days. Hope your
    Thanksgiving was as wonderful as ours. Jon Christopher, Mike, Nina, and
    Elizabeth were here ( Columbia) for Thanksgiving. As usual, we talked, ate,
    and enjoyed each other. It has become a family tradition to go to
    Shakespeares Pizza, Ernies (ERNWAS) Steakhouse, and Booches (Hamburgers)
    everytime any family member comes. Nina cooked some Russian quisine. The
    weather was fairly decent for Missouri Thanksgiving (dry, 30 - 50 F).
    Elizabeth saw Rugrats in Paris. Dalmations , and went to the parks. We
    stayed behind and did other things including watching "Hurricane", a very
    powerful movie.  Today we have been taking care of all those errands and
    routines that are necessary after a weekend of company. We had a good time.


    I talked to Ruby last evening. She has probably telephoned both of you by
    now. She is sending some cookies to all of us, mostly using Mother's
    recipes. How thankful I am to still have her.  And she seems to be in good
    health. She is always so positive. She says that the second week in August
    is probably the best weekend for the family reunion at our place in Crane
    next year.  That would be August 11. How would that be for the two of you?
    It would be fine with us. If you are in agreement I will send out the
    invitations soon. If not, let me know so I can change it as you are two
    important people for us and for the whole family.

    We will be going to Thailand on February 5 and returning on March 4. I will
    give you all numbers etc where we can be reached. We will have an apartment
    in Bangkok but will be all over the Country. Karl and Ila Kruse will be with
    us for two weeks. We are really looking forward to it.

    Ken and Linda, we really enjoyed seeing you in Columbia. As usual you were
    at your  best.

    Sharon, We are having our usual big Christmas party on December 23. Any
    chance you would be coming to Columbia? We would sure love to have you if
    you
     can.
    Ken We discussed getting together in Dec. That may not be possible because
    of all of our schedules. If not lets look at jAN. For both of you, what does
    your schedule look like?
    Thats all for now. Let me know about the family reunion date (Sat, Aug. 11)
    as soon as possible. Talk to you soon. Love. Bonnie

    Dr. Lay:

    You will be pleasantly surprised to receive this e-mail from an Enron=20
    Employee.

    Please note that you are the first and only person in Enron that will know=
    =20
    about the endeavors that this e-mail discusses.

    Background:
    In 1986 while I was taking a graduate course in Economics as part of my MBA=
    =20
    program, I started to think that there exists some similarities between=20
    Economics and Thermodynamics. In 1988, I discussed my initial thoughts with=
    =20
    Dr. Ibrahim Oweiss, professor of Economics at Georgetown University and we=
    =20
    agreed to investigate this topic. Since that time, I worked with Professor=
    =20
    Oweiss on and off investigating the subject. In the last couple of years, w=
    e=20
    started to make good progress, that was culminated recently by submitting=
    =20
    three papers for publication (see table below). =20

    =09Part I: =01&Basics=018
    =09=09This part identifies certain analogies between Economics and Thermody=
    namics.=20
    The analogies between =01&Abilities=018 and =01&Energy=018, =01&Utility=018=
     and =01&Work=018,=20
    =01&Capital=018 and =01&Heat=018, =01&Marginal Utility=018 and =01&Pressure=

    and =01&Temperature=018, as well as =01&LABOR EFFORT=018 and =01&Entropy=01=
    8 are discussed.
    =09=09This part concludes that the suggested analogies bring about new appr=
    oaches=20
    that will explain some economic complexities by borrowing or building upon=
    =20
    some  concepts, theories and experiences in Thermodynamics.
    =09=09Part II: =01&Applications=018
    =09=09This second Part builds upon the basics introduced in Part I where an=
    alogies=20
    between Economics and Thermodynamics have been drawn. In this Part, the=20
    application of the analogies is utilized to analyze some of the topics=20
    economists deal with. This Part presents a fresh approach that holds=20
    promising vehicles that can explain some of the paradoxes economists have=
    =20
    been facing for years. =09Submitted for publications as a working paper at =

    =09=09Unlike the conventional approach of relating production to Capital an=

    along the line suggested by Cobb Douglas, the approach this paper takes is=
    =20
    relating the production to utility change which in turn is related to chang=
    es=20
    in capital and labor effort.=20
    =09=09This approach affords more generality and helps in the explanation of=
     some=20
    paradoxes that the Cobb Douglas theory could not explain. =09Submitted for=

    exhibits.
    =09=09It is also used to explain gains in productivity associated with tech=

    improvements.

        =20
    A fourth paper entitled "Innovation: Why" is under preparation. In this=20
    paper, we are able to substantiate  based on the concept of  the Capital=20
    Engine that innovation is the most important driver for economic growth. Yo=
    u=20
    can see why I chose these two words in the title of the paper from my Enron=
    =20
    world.

    I have been collaborating with Professor Oweiss on my own time and I am=20
    pleased that we managed to get to this point. Professor Oweiss and I are no=
    w=20
    convinced that we have reached some breakthroughs that could revolutionize=
    =20
    the study of Economics. We also feel that we can build further on what we=
    =20
    reached, and even making more valuable contributions.

    I am sure that you will be pleased to learn of the above, of course being a=
    n=20
    Economist you shall appreciate it even more.

    As I reach this critical stage on our path of this research project,  I wou=
    ld=20
    like to seek Enron support in two areas:

    I.   Patent(s) / Copy Righting:
         I feel that the contributions that are covered in the three papers are=
    =20
    original and may warrant patenting / copy righting.=20
         Since I am the primary author of these papers I wanted to have some=20
    credit go to Enron.

    II.  Grant / Sponsorship:
         I feel that my endeavors which have been purely on my own personal tim=
    e=20
    so far, need to be replaced by a more concerted effort now that we have=20
    reached a =20
         critical mass. Towards this end, Dr. Oweiss and myself are taking step=
    s=20
    to get funding from the National Science Foundation for a joint research=20
    project that=20
         would be carried out through the Georgetown University.
         I do not know of any particular programs within Enron that would affor=
    d=20
    me the opportunity to complete a project like the one we are envisaging. =
    =20
         I feel that such a research program will be very valuable.  I am furth=
    er=20
    convinced that such program will not be only of an academic value but it wi=
    ll=20
    have=20
         significant impact to the business world.

     I trust that the publicity that Enron being the leading company in=20
    innovation would get out of the success that I am hoping for  the proposed=
    =20
    research project will be many folds the amount of money Enron would=20
    contribute to the proposed effort.=20

    I would be delighted to send you copies of the three papers and / or make a=
    =20
    brief presentation on the subject.

    I wish to thank you for taking the time to read the above e-mail amid your=
    =20
    busy schedule.=20

    GE's Jeffrey R. Immelt=20
    His Focus On The Customer Boosted Him To The Top=20
    By Patrick Seitz
    Investor's Business Daily
    Jeffrey R. Immelt, the man chosen to succeed the legendary Jack Welch as=20
    chief executive of General Electric Co., knows there's just one person=20
    keeping him in business: the customer. And that customer is the person Imme=
    lt=20
    goes all-out to please.
    Immelt, 44, was plucked from the company's fast-growing GE Medical Systems=
    =20
    business, where he had served as president and chief executive since 1997.=
    =20
    The $7 billion unit, based in Waukesha, Wis., is a world leader in medical=
    =20
    diagnostic technology and information systems.
    Immelt attributes much of his success to his laserlike focus on sales.
    "I love working with customers. . . . Sales has really influenced everythin=
    g=20
    I do. It has instilled in me the important traits of operating with a sense=
    =20
    of urgency and listening to people," Immelt said.
    Immelt on Monday was named president and chairman-elect of GE. He will=20
    succeed John F. "Jack" Welch Jr., GE's chairman and CEO, when Welch retires=
    =20
    at the end of 2001.
    When Immelt landed at GE Medical Systems in 1997, he quickly showed a knack=
    =20
    for squeezing growth from a unit known for sluggish sales. Last year, its=
    =20
    revenue jumped 23% to $6 billion.
    Customers credit Immelt with going way beyond sales. When Chicago's=20
    Northwestern Memorial Hospital expanded its scanning services last year,=20
    Immelt spent hours helping to manage its work flow.
    "That's the kind of collaboration that we find unusual," Northwestern=20
    Memorial CEO Gary Mecklenburg told Business Week.
    Immelt has proven himself both by turning around troubled GE divisions and=
    =20
    extracting better performance from thriving units.
    Immelt knows how important it is to set the pace, not follow it. To keep GE=
    =20
    Medical flourishing, he's pushed the unit to expand acquisitions and new=20
    product offerings. The division's product line ranges from ultrasound devic=
    es=20
    used in doctors' offices to multimillion-dollar CT and MRI scanners.
    In his earlier work in GE's Plastics division, Immelt stood out by persuadi=
    ng=20
    hard-boiled carmakers to substitute plastics for metal on some parts.
    As vice president of consumer service for GE's Appliances division, Immelt=
    =20
    deftly handled the fallout from a recall of refrigerator compressors. To ke=
    ep=20
    workers' morale pumped up during the recall, Immelt would often climb up on=
     a=20
    forklift in GE's Louisville, Ky., plant and pass out words of encouragement=
    =20
    and praise. He took time to speak with employees during such sessions,=20
    listening carefully to their ideas and concerns.
    Immelt believes that open, fast communication with workers is crucial. Not =
    a=20
    table-thumper, he meets with employees =01) sometimes hundreds at a time =
    =01) to=20
    discuss where GE Medical is going. Colleagues say he works at=20
    consensus-building, urging others to understand different points of view.
    After returning from corporate meetings, Immelt distills the latest GE=20
    thinking on videotape, and copies are sent to offices around the world.
    Understanding that seeing someone face to face helps foster stronger=20
    relationships, Immelt also travels often to meet employees and customers.=

    Constant contact keeps a company united, Immelt believes. So he updates the=

    new=20
    business, lost sales opportunities and other nuggets about company=20
    initiatives. E-mail is sent in five languages, and at times up to a dozen,=
    =20
    according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
    Immelt was one of three GE executives who analysts considered possible=20
    successors to Welch. Welch, 65, has been at the helm of the Fairfield,=20
    Conn.-based finance, industrial and broadcasting powerhouse for the past tw=
    o=20
    decades.=20
    "Jeff Immelt is a natural leader, and ideally suited to lead GE for many=20
    years," Welch said. "He brings a keen strategic intellect, a cutting-edge=
    =20
    technological background, strong leadership characteristics and a unique se=
    t=20
    of team-building skills."
    Knowing that preparation is key to long-term success, Immelt has long been=
    =20
    preparing himself, says Charles M. Lillis, a former GE executive who hired=
    =20
    Immelt in 1982.
    "Starting in high school, (in) everything he did he was a leader," Lillis=
    =20
    told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. "He played football. He was a student=
    =20
    leader. He went to Procter & Gamble after college and he did a great job in=
    =20
    sales. He also had the right balance of self-confidence and awareness that =
    he=20
    did not know everything."
    Immelt has strong marketing skills and helped create the GE slogan, "We bri=
    ng=20
    good things to life," in his first job at GE.
    Analysts and friends say the 6-foot, 4-inch Immelt possesses not only a=20
    commanding physical presence but also the intellectual strength necessary t=
    o=20
    inspire management and workers at GE. Immelt believes that a consistent=20

    of Pennsylvania on a trade mission.

    Mr. Quain would be available after 1:00 p.m. CST, tomorrow, Thursday, or
    Friday at the latest for this conference call.  We will handle the logistics
    of the call.

    Kindly call me at (717) 783-8021, my direct line number, if Chairman Lay can

    Ken,

    Sorry to miss you today when I called. Since I am leaving for India in a
    few minutes, I thought I would sent you an E-mail, and then I can try to
    call you from India. Because of the time difference, it will not be easy
    for us to connect. Unfortunately I will not be back in the US until
    December 7.

    The reason for my call was to see if you would feel comfortable putting my
    name forward to Dick Cheney for a position in the new administration. I am
    not sure where the best fit would be, but it might be Chairman of the
    National Economic Council. That job has a good combination of management
    and economics. You know I have only been associated with Democratic
    administrations in past, but Democratic administrations were a little
    different in those days. You are somewhat familiar with my record on
    economics and there is a lot on that in the public domain.

    Just let me know what you think. Maybe a quick E-mail would suffice ( I am
    carrying my computer).

    Best regards,
    Bill

    The discovery that a Texas-based crime lab technician fabricated phony=20

    an already strong case against the American criminal justice system,=20
    according to Independent Institute Research Fellow Paul Craig Roberts.

    "The criminal justice system has lost the ability to screen out unbalanced=
    =20
    people who use their offices not to serve justice, but to serve bureaucrati=
    c=20
    success indicators such as conviction rates, propagandistic causes and tort=
    =20
    lawyers. If truth be known, some of the worst criminals in the country are=

    CALIFORNIANS NEED MORE ELECTRICITY DEREGULATION, NOT LESS

    The huge jump in electricity rates in parts of California last summer cause=
    d=20
    many to believe that the state's deregulation of the electric power industr=
    y=20
    was a mistake. In response, the state's "Independent System Operator" (ISO)=
    ,=20
    the quasi-government agency that manages electricity transmission, imposed=
    =20
    short-term price ceilings on wholesale electricity rates; its renewal of th=
    e=20
    price caps last month, extending indefinitely, appears to be the beginning =
    of=20
    electricity re-regulation.

    However, the ISO's price caps ensure that Californians will face future=20
    problems, writes Scott Esposito, public affairs intern at The Independent=
    =20
    Institute, in a new op-ed.

    "The ISO's price caps are a case of a remedy that is far worse than the=20
    disease," writes Esposito. "By capping the price that generators may sell=
    =20
    their electricity at $250 per megawatt hour, the ISO=01,s proposal would ma=
    ke=20
    California a market that no sane generator would enter. Why sell electricit=
    y=20
    in California for, at most, $250 per megawatt hour, when you can sell it in=
    =20
    New York for up to $1300 per megawatt hour?"

    Californians would be better served by abolishing the ISO and opening=20
    electricity transmission to the free market, thereby encouraging the=20
    development of new transmission capacity, Esposito argues.

    "Massive rate hikes leading to $400 August electricity bills in San Diego,=
    =20
    and extensive blackouts in San Francisco, have made utility deregulation lo=
    ok=20
    like a mistake. However, the real mistake lies not with utility deregulatio=
    n=20
    per se but with its incomplete execution."

    URBAN RIOTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES

    Despite pleas by the Bush and Gore camps that their supporters abide by the=
    =20
    rule of law (if only they could agree on *which* election rules and court=
    =20
    rulings are applicable), the election mess may turn decidedly uglier --=20
    especially if Florida's presidential vote is sent to the Florida Legislatur=
    e,=20
    a possibility described in last week's LIGHTHOUSE.

    That's why it is imperative that Ralph Nader, Jesse Jackson, sundry agit-pr=
    op=20
    talk show personalities, and other self-appointed spokespersons for the=20
    "disenfranchised," voice their commitment to civic order.

    The lesson of the urban riots of the 1960s is instructive.

    The long, hot summers of 1965 to 1968 saw more than three hundred riots,=20
    resulting in two hundred deaths and the destruction of several thousand=20
    businesses, according to historian Jonathan J. Bean, writing in the fall=20
    issue of THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW. Egged on by ideologues, rioters looted=20
    unprotected stores to the chant of "burn, baby, burn."

    After the rioting stopped, a cottage industry of politicians, academics and=

    ignored, and some inner-city neighborhoods never recovered, as evidenced by=
    =20
    the hackneyed image of politicians visiting blighted inner cities and=20
    promising, if elected, to do for it what his opponent cannot.

    If political operatives in the current election mess wish to cultivate an=

  subject: Mariner
  text: "Ken, in response to your note, I am not aware of any official dialogue with
    \nMr. Kase Lawal about a potential sale of Mariner or with the economics of the
    \naborted IPO.  His $250 M valuation may have been appropriate 12 to 18 months
    \nago.  However, Mariner has enjoyed a series of successful wells that are \nexpected
    to be booked in reserve reports next March not to mention \nsignificant increases
    in gas and oil prices.  Our current valuations, in the \n$600M range is a stretch
    target but not incredibly out of line given reserve \ngrowth and current energy
    prices.  Our current goal, is to be able to \ndemonstrate three to four quarters
    of increasing operating cashflow and \nreserves growth before attempting a private
    sale mid next year to a \nsignificant E&P concern that desires an offshore division.
    \ The \nconcentration, operating and exploration risk implicit in Mariner make
    it a \nvery poor IPO candidate ((ie) I'm not sure that an IPO was ever a viable
    \nstrategy to maximize the exit value).\n\nI would recommend that we not meet
    to make the following points:\n a) Mariner is not on the market at this point
    in time and\n b)  his un-solicited offer does not warrant serious attention.\n\nOtherwise,
    we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to \nsell tha asset.\n\nI
    hope this meets with your approval.\n\nRegards\nDelainey\n"

  text: "Ken and Jeff,\n\nAs I think you both know I have been active in recruiting
    at Cornell for the \nEnron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently
    have become \ninvolved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board
    which \nprovides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.
    \ They \nare holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will
    \ninclude the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their
    \ncompany's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to \nask
    you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would \nreally
    highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a \"Core School\" in \nthe MBA
    recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for \nMarch 28th.
    \ I appreciate your consideration.\n\nKevin\n\n----- Forwarded by Kevin Hannon/Enron

    cc: \n\t\t Subject: \n\nKevin-\n\n\nJust a quick follow-up on my November 2 email
    regarding Enron's\nparticipation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week
    and the\npossibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had
    a\nchance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on\nyou
    plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. \nBelow is the
    earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all\nis well with you.\n\n\n
    \           Nov.2 email text\n\n\nWe at Cornell's Johnson School would like to
    establish a stronger link\nwith Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading
    example of the\nagile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable\nmarkets
    of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like\nEnron to consider
    is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic\nOrganizations which draws faculty
    and students from across Cornell and\nbeyond.\n\n\nThe specific activities that
    we propose at this point in time are two. \nFirst, we would like to invite a senior
    leader from Enron to be a key\nspeaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week
    in March, 2001.  As\ndescribed in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made
    up of three\nconferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations
    and\nstudents.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a \"live\ncase
    study\" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,\n2001</underline>.\n\n\nYou,
    of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this\nis the kind
    of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay\nand would give them
    a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and\nthe Cornell community.
    \ Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the\ncorporate conference are
    John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken\nChenault, incoming CEO of American
    Express, Marty Coyne, just announced\nPresident of Kodak's new Commercial Group.
    \ Each of these leaders has a\ndistinct message to deliver about the leadership
    challenges involved in\ncontinually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing
    marketplace.  \n\n\nWe have several other speakers lined up for other parts of
    Leadership\nWeek, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman\nSachs.
    \ We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company\nand an outside
    shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank\nRhodes, but these are
    still long shots.\n\n\nThe point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen
    at the\nJohnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted\na
    platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If\nthey can't
    do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the\ndate is March 28,
    2001.       \n\n\nThe second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along
    the same\nlines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it\ncould
    become the basis for the March conference live case study\npresentation.  We believe
    that Enron is unique in its ability to\nliterally create new markets.  The question
    is how do you lead and manage\nan organization to keep the tight financial and
    risk controls in place\nthat you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior
    that seems to\nbe the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems
    and\npractices make this possible.\n\n\nI know that Enron was the subject of two
    Harvard cases in 1993 and around\n1997.  As I understand it neither focused on
    organizational and\nleadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research
    team to\nbuilding this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee
    Dyer\nfrom the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the\nEnron
    organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast\nmoving organizations
    and are committed to doing this in a very efficient\nway.\n\n\nKevin, we appreciate
    your willingness to entertain these two ideas and\nhopefully test them with your
    top leaders.  We will do anything we can to\nmake it feasible for Enron to engage
    with us on these two initiatives. \nPlease let me know what I can do to help you
    carry this forward.  As\nalways, thanks for your great personal support.\n\n\nDick\n"

    to\ndebrief on this loss and also to listen to a number of other points he\nraised
    that could improve the the way we work together. Philippe was very\nhelpful and
    very direct - which I appreciate.\n\nSome of the reasons we lost this bid is that
    we failed to execute the sales\nprocess as I would expect us to. This is not typical
    of the way we should\nnow work and we have made changes to account management
    and service\nrepresentation.\n\nWe have made enormous progress as a Corporation
    over the last twelve months.\nThere is a lot of good news in many accounts around

    for the \nAnalyst Program.  We have also spoken to the Portland Office regarding

    he was not extended an offer by the Portland Office.  When they \ncalled to tell
    him such, his response was, \"that's OK because I did not want \nto work there
    anyway.\"\n\nI am doubtful that he will fare well in the interview process but

  subject: Dabhol Status
  text: "Jeff/Ken:\n\nI heard from Wade that there were a number of questions on Dabhol
    yesterday \nand I thought it may help if u received a quick update. Over the last
    3 days, \nI have met with most key players in GOI and GOM assisted by some very
    close \nfriends of ours. The start of the state assembly session has given some
    \npoliticians and some vested interests an opportunity to raise issues about \nDabhol
    in the assembly again, a feature that we have seen every year, at \nabout this
    time, without exception and has led to a number of misleading \nnewspaper reports.
    The usual suspects are behind the latest stirring of the \npot. \n\nThe facts
    however are as follows:\n\n1. GOM (at the administrative and political level)
    and MSEB remain firmly \nbehind the project and the commitments to it. They are
    concerned but at the \nsame time looking at proactively working to find a solution.
    They also \nbelieve that they may have found one that is agreeable to GOI.\n\n2.
    After discussions with us on Tuesday, GOM and MSEB are working on a plan  \n(thru
    this weekend) to treat Dabhol as a national asset. The plan involves \nMSEB selling
    \ power from DPC to the central government utility which will \nthen pool the
    power with over 30,000 MW of power that they currently  control \nand sell the
    power onward to other states. The plan has already been \ndiscussed at senior
    levels in the GOI and finds general acceptance. Obviously \nthe details are to
    be worked out and we are proceeding to help GOM put the \noutline together over
    this weekend in Delhi and GOM will then discuss it with \nMOP on Monday. \n\nWade
    reported that it was felt that the seniormost GOI ministers be apprised  \nof
    the seriousness which with we are viewing this situation. This was already \ndone
    Tuesday.\n\n3. The Indian Lenders to the Dabhol project have met and agreed to
    a 30 day \nwaiver of MSEB delay in payment - agreed subject to review of the situation
    \nat the end of 6 months. They have also agreed to the Equity transfer - \nsubject
    to lenders counsel confirming that there are no legal issues under \nany of the
    project contracts. This shows the lender support for continuing to \nmove forward
    and buys us time to put in place the fix we are planning.\n\n4. Ministry of Power
    has yesterday agreed to support an effort to freeze the \nduties on imported fuel
    at a lower level of about $12/bbl versus the current \n$35 or so. This will help
    achieve an immediate reduction in tariff from Phase \nI and make Dabhol more competitive.
    This proposal is currently with Ministry \nof Finance and our expectation is that
    they will review it favorably as the \nMOP is taking it up personally.\n\nAll
    signs that I have received in India over the last few days lead me to \nbelieve
    that the GOM is committed to solving the Dabhol issues at the \nearliest. While
    we all have concerns, they seem to be addressable and if the \ncurrent plan is
    successful, they can  be sorted out within the context of \ncurrent and existing
    documentation.\n\nI have left names out but they are better discussed on the call
    that has been \nscheduled for Monday evening India time. Hope that this helps
    in the meantime.\n\nRegards,\n\nSanjay"

    of the US.\n\nI've been a Houston-based employee of Enron for nearly 10 years,
    of which \nseven were with the Dabhol project.  I obtained my green card in 1992,
    which \nentitled me to apply for US citizenship in 1997.  I recently went through
    the \nfinal interview and was awaiting a call to take oath.\n\nInstead, the INS
    denied my application for citizenship on grounds of my \nextensive travel.  This,
    despite the fact that:\n\n(1).  A disqualification can be made only if an applicant
    is \n\n- out of the country for a continuous period of six months; or\n- is out
    of the country for more than 30 months in the sixty month period \nafter the green

    Editorial - TEACHING AN OLD INDUSTRY NEW TRICKS VIA THE INTERNET

    The concept of =01&E-learning=018 is basically an old idea that has come ba=
    ck into
    vogue with the never-ending possibilities offered by the World Wide Web.
    From training employees to collaborating and sharing information with
    business partners and suppliers, today=01,s businesses are utilizing web
    technology to broaden their share of the market.

    Uday Om Pabrai calls E-learning the Internet=01,s =01&next killer applicati=
    on.=018
    Pabrai is a longtime web-watcher, having founded Net Guru Technologies in
    1992, and having created the first webmaster certification
    standard-Certified Internet Webmaster. He is now chairman of the AIP
    Certification and Accreditation Council.

    The energy industry, though cautious about utilizing the web, is scrambling
    to take advantage of this next big thing.  Recently, several top companies
    have taken the plunge to hire Internet professionals to develop their own
    virtual training programs.

    Equiva Services LLC, a joint venture company formed by Texaco Inc., Shell
    Oil Company and Saudi Refining, Inc, ABB Vetco Gray, and Columbia Gulf
    Transmission Company, have all recently jumped on the e-learning bandwagon.
    All three companies have created web-based platforms or e-commerce hubs tha=
    t
    enable employees to quickly and conveniently get necessary training from
    pre-selected suppliers.

    =01&This type of innovative application of information technology will help=
     us
    to work smarter and faster for our internal clients,=018 said Mari Duarte,
    senior human resources generalist for ABB Vetco Gray.  =01&We expect to low=
    er
    costs and improve efficiency by reducing the time of administrative
    transactions related to registration and by improving reporting of
    information related to training activities to management.=018

    For the energy industry, E-learning can involve both the automation of
    training management systems as well as the transmission and delivery of
    learning to individuals through use of the Internet.  Through this
    technology, training information previously available through classroom
    instruction can be delivered directly to employees=01, desktops in differen=
    t
    forms, ranging from basic presentation-style courses to highly interactive
    courses with digitized video transmissions and on-line discussions.

    =01&E-learning can encompass training employees and it can be used to share
    important knowledge across the organization and with outside business
    partners,=018 said Dennis McMullin, energy industry consultant at Proxicom,=
     a
    leading Internet consulting firm in Houston, Texas.  McMullin says that mor=
    e
    companies are increasing the amount of training they offer online to help
    employees stay current on market trends and personal skills.  =01&There can=
     be
    a significant cost savings involved in using technology for learning, but a
    company=01,s success ultimately depends on how effectively it can bring the
    technology into the organization and how well they use it.=018

    E-learning technology can also ease the administrative burden on an
    organization=01,s human resources department and lower the per-unit cost of
    training employees.  Additionally, management has the ability to better
    analyze training needs and how to best deploy the information.  =01&Web-bas=
    ed
    training is extremely flexible and offers employees convenience in
    scheduling courses when they need and want them,=018 said McMullin.  =01&It=
     also
    allows them the opportunity to go back and revisit course material if the
    need a refresher or a resource.  It is a self-teaching method that lets
    individuals learn at their own pace and based on their own needs."

    Internet companies such as VerticalNet, Inc. in Horsham, PA, offer companie=
    s
    the ability to manage training programs through an Internet interface that
    directly links the company with training suppliers.  Taken one stop further=
    ,
    VerticalNet=01,s =01&Training Intelligence Portals=018 enable companies to =
    centralize
    their personnel training programs and literally outsource administration an=
    d
    other back-office transactions such as invoice management, utilization
    reporting, course evaluation and quality assurance.

    According to Walter Rogers, VerticalNet=01,s eBusiness training services se=
    nior
    director and general manager, the energy industry is becoming more
    aggressive in moving from office administration and classroom learning to
    web-based technology for training.  =01&We=01,re seeing a lot more demand f=
    rom the
    energy sector for e-learning technology,=018 said Rogers, whose firm is
    currently working with several large energy companies.  =01&We=01,ve found =
    that
    the energy industry doesn=01,t typically lead the way in the use of technol=
    ogy.
    It tends to want to see it working and proven in other areas before they tr=
    y
    it.  But now they are getting more involved.  Since the industry is driven
    to reduce operating costs, it finds this technology to be very cost
    effective.=018

    In addition to hiring Internet experts to develop and manage a training
    site, Dennis McMullin points out that there is a large variety of existing
    training opportunities for on-line learning.  =01&Most of the technology
    companies offer on-line training for technical products, while numerous web
    sites offer free information and opportunities for e-learning,=018 he said.

    In the end, however, McMullin believes that acceptance of the Internet is
    more than a technological issue for many companies, rather it requires a
    cultural adjustment.  =01&It really is an issue of adjusting the company
    culture to accept and benefit from Internet technology.  It requires
    companies to be more open and less fearful of sharing information.  Energy
    companies could really benefit from effective use of the Internet if they
    use it as a median to share more knowledge throughout their organizations
    and with suppliers.=018

    Dear Mr.Lay,

    I hope this email finds you looking forward to the approching holiday
    season. I thought I would take this opportunity to drop you a quick email
    and express my interest in Enron for my future. My name is Dulari Mehta and
    we first met at the Davenport Society Dinner in October at the University of
    Missouri-Columbia. I was escorting Mr. Walker and I was sitting at your
    table. I again had a chance to speak with you at the Mosaic Society Dinner
    in November. On both occasions I enjoyed speaking with you and exchanging
    ideas about India.

    As this semester closes and I begin to plan my next one, I am looking at
    opportunites that await me once I graduate in May of 2001. I have spent some
    time looking at your website and I am very intersted in Enron as a possible
    place to work. I am especially interested in your project management area
    and/or international opportunities. I have attached my resume to this email.
    I would love to hear from you as to your thoughts on my resume and a
    possible future at Enron.

    All my current and permanent contact information is on my resume. I will be
    out of the country and in India from December 22 to January 13. I hope you
    and your family have a wonderful holiday season. I very eagerly await
    hearing from you.

    Thank you for you time and consideration,
    Dulari Mehta

  subject: Availability for Thursday, January 11, Board Panel
  text: |+
    Topic:  The Increasingly Critical Role of Boards in Today's Rapidly Changing

    World

    Here is the concept:

    Today's Board of Directors are confronted by unprecedented complex issues
    (globalization, optimizing board size for responsiveness, CEO
    disintermediation, diversity, option repricing, CEO evaluation, board member

    removal, increasing importance of audit committee, diverse shareholder time
    horizons (for whom do we manage?)

    These Board issues confront both large established companies as well as
    emerging growth companies.  Spencer Stuart would like to host a provocative
    examination of  issues common to Boards of today as a panel delves into some

    of the issues common to boards at both ends of the spectrum.

    Spencer Stuart is the market dominator in Board of Directors work.  Tom Neff

    and Julie Daum, leaders of SpencerStuart's global board practice, will lead
    a
    lively discussion with our distinguished panel.

    Target                   CEO's and Board Members
    Audience:

    Format:                 Invitation Only

    Anticipated
    Audience:               25-30

    Time and Place:      8 am, Omni Hotel
        Houston, TX

    We feel that it would be very powerful (and we would be most appreciative)
    to
    have Ken and Mark Lay on the panel addressing issues confronting boards of
    today, representing their respective backgrounds and experiences of serving
    on boards.

    I'd be happy to go over this in greater detail.  Call me at (713) 225-1621.

    Please let me know as soon as possible if this date works with your
    calendar.

    Ken,

    I just wanted to drop you an email to touch base on the Institute.

    Yesterday, I went to see Stuart's workshop of three new original musical
    theatre productions at UH. It was very exciting, and even more so knowing
    that we can take his efforts to a new level with the establishment of the
    Insitute.

    Anyway, I just wanted to check in with you. I hope all is well, and look

  subject: Transactions in Lilly Stock
  text: |
    This is a reminder of your ongoing obligation to report to the Securities
    and Exchange Commission ("SEC") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of
    the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe
    penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any
    transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,
    including:

    -   purchases
    -   sales
    -   gifts
    -   trust or partnership transactions
    -   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
    -   exchange fund transactions

    We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
    reasons:

       There are certain times when you should not engage in market
       transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these "black-outs" occur around
       the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
       announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of "inside
       information" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
       reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
       While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
       you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
       legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

    2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

    If you had any Lilly stock transactions in November, please advise me as
    soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
    and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").  The
    reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
    of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
    not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
    proposed transaction.

    If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
    to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

    Ken,
         Thank you very much for giving Gordon and me so much time.  It was a
    real pleasure seeing you again, and I certainly hope we get to do something
    together.  Gordon and Greg are going to continue their discussion around
    specific issues.  For IFC, I am actively talking to your team on weather
    insurance and  think we can proceed.   It would good for me to stay in
    touch with you---I have already explained to Peter Woicke, the head of IFC,
    that Enron  and GEC are really the models for us in modern finance and
    markets.   If you ever have time in Washington, please do give a call.
    Have a wonderful holiday season.
    Best,   Nina

    Speaking of my travels...\n> This month I visited Johannesburg, South Africa,
    Dubai within the United\n> Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia.  All of these countries
    are part of\n> EMEA's Business Development Group (BDG), which is responsible for\n>
    developing Compaq business in 98 countries. The group is focused on both\n> developed
    and emerging markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and\n> Africa. Over the
    past six years, BDG has grown its revenue more than\n> 10-fold.\n>\n> In South
    Africa I visited Vodacom, which with 4 million subscribers, is\n> Africa's largest
    mobile phone network operator.  The company has just\n> upgraded its billing systems
    to handle further expansion, and to date is\n> one of the world's largest Wildfire
    installations with some 21 AlphaServer\n> GS systems.  I also spent time with
    the management of Mobile Telephone\n> Networks (MTN), South Africa's #2 cellphone
    operator and another big\n> Wildfire customer.  In fact, we just got word that
    they've placed a $10M\n> order for four GS320 AlphaServer systems and storage.\n>\n>
    One of my more interesting activities while there was learning more about\n> Ikageng,
    a Compaq-led initiative to bring the benefits of the information\n> age to the
    rural communities of Africa.  Ikageng brings together the\n> provision of safe
    drinking water, affordable healthcare, distance\n> learning, improved subsistence
    farming techniques and Internet access.\n> All of this is co-funded by a community

    Gitex, the\n> region's largest IT exhibition, and met with press at that event

    Cross Border Office files first lawsuit\n> The Cross Border Office has been created
    to prevent unauthorized movement\n> of Compaq products by dealers and gray market
    brokers in order to protect\n> profit margins and ultimately, customer satisfaction.
    \ The Cross Border\n> team provides gray market awareness training to all sales
    personnel, mail\n> and phone hotline access to report gray market activity, works
    jointly\n> with regional sales, services, business unit and channel teams to create\n>
    policy and procedures to reduce gray market activity and, working with the\n>
    Law department, to bring legal action against gray market brokers if\n> warranted.\n>\n>
    As a result of these efforts, Compaq has filed its first lawsuit against\n> two
    Canadian technology consulting firms for breach of contract and fraud.\n> The
    suit, which seeks compensatory damages of more than $17 million,\n> claims the
    consulting firms fraudulently represented to Compaq that they\n> had a contract
    with the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal\n> Aviation Administration
    to supply a large number of computers and related\n> equipment to U.S. airports.
    This lawsuit hit many national publications\n> and sends a message to the worldwide
    gray market community that Compaq\n> will take actions to protect its authorized
    resellers, product quality and\n> our customers.\n>\n> For further information

    Key Channel Partner programs rolling out\n> Early this year the Tigerbite project
    was established to redefine and\n> simplify Compaq's model with our channel partners.
    \ A key element of the\n> model is worldwide programs that provide profitable
    growth opportunities\n> for Compaq and its partners.  Two such programs - Internet
    List Pricing\n> (ILP) and the Compaq Agent Program - are currently being implemented
    by\n> the regions.\n>\n> Worldwide implementation of ILP is a top priority for
    the company.\n> Creating and publishing (where needed) competitive List Prices
    is\n> absolutely essential to establishing a more consistent, worldwide pricing\n>
    model for both our customers and partners. By the end of this month ILP\n> will
    have been implemented in North America, Latin America, Japan and\n> Greater China,
    with pilot programs in Singapore and Malaysia.  EMEA and\n> the remaining Asia
    Pacific countries are expected to complete the rollout\n> by January 1, 2001.\n>\n>
    The Compaq Agent Program, which allows partners to earn commissions when\n> they
    refer customers to purchase products/services directly from us,\n> currently has
    been implemented in the U.S., Latin America (14 countries)\n> and CKK.  This month,
    APD is implementing pilot programs in Singapore and\n> Malaysia, and plans to
    roll out the program in seven additional countries\n> in the first quarter.  EMEA
    held an Agent Program Summit this month with\n> 10 countries to assess and develop
    their 2001 rollout plans which include\n> adding Enterprise-class products to
    their program next year.\n>\n> News from the Compaq Alliances team\n> *      Compaq
    regained the #1 platform partner position with SAP with 33%\n> market share over
    all platforms (NT, UNIX with R/3, and mySAP.com). IBM is\n> 2nd in line with 23%
    share. In North America alone, our overall SAP share\n> increased from 25% to
    32% in the third quarter.  As an aside, SAP's entire\n> executive board and senior
    executive staff use our iPAQ Pocket PCs.\n> Rollout of the product to SAP Sales

    Dear Mr. Lay,

    You might recall very kindly hosting a dinner at The Travellers Club in
    London for the first energy retreat that we did with Reinhold Heus and Ralph
    Hodge. We were very sorry to have missed you this year though we very much
    understand that campaigning for the elections was an absolute priority.

    I was very pleased to hear that you had tentatively agreed to be able to
    make the 25th May free for next years retreat. This years theme, after a
    great del of research is set to focus on e commerce and the new economy and
    will look at the inter relationship between energy, communication and
    investment. I therefore thought that it would be particularly appropriate
    given the outstanding work that you are doing in this area. I am sure that
    you will feel that the participants are of great interest and I hope that it
    will be a real learning experience for both the state companies and the
    international energy companies.

    As before the group will be limited to 60 top-level executives from
    multinationals, independents and state companies and we would aim that some
    of the main issues to be covered include:
    * Corporate renewal - develop and maintain a competitive edge
    * Diversification in the energy industry: into telecommunications,
    power, water, e-commerce, trading, auto  - energy in the new economy
    * E - Commerce
    * Breakthrough in new technologies

    I do hope that you are able to confirm your keynote attendance and look
    forward to hearing from you.

    I also thought that you might be interested in the attached outlining the
    governments with which we work.
    I very much look forward to hearing from you. .

    In the meantime I remain,

    Yours sincerely,


     <<...>>

    \ You may \nrecall that we have spoken several times when you visited TCW for
    the Board \nof Directors meetings.  Previously I worked in TCW's Latin America
    investment \ndepartment and have followed Enron's investments in Latin America.
    \ I am now \nworking as an analyst for TCW's equity research department.   With
    the \nencouragement of Robert Day and Leigh Crawford, whom you met with recently
    in \nPhoenix, I am considering making a recommendation for the purchase of Enron
    \nstock.\n\nI am writing to you to solicit your help in setting up a visit to
    Enron for \nLeigh Crawford and myself.  We are interested in meeting with you,
    Clifford \nBaxter, Jeffrey Skilling, Andrew Fastow, Mark Koenig, Richard Buy and
    any \nother individuals you believe would be helpful in our understanding your
    \nbusiness.  We would also welcome the opportunity to tour Enron's facilities.\n\nThe
    date of the visit can be chosen for the convenience of you and the other \nmanagers.
    \ The week of December 18th and the early weeks of January are \nparticularly
    convenient for us.\n\nThank you very much for your help and I look forward to

    \ \nMy prayers were answered.  I am proud to be a part of this team and look \nforward
    to many years of prosperity and success.  After working for a private \npractice
    for 10 years and being told that the corporate work environment was \nimpersonal,
    I have seen ENRON promote and display respect, integrity, \ncommunication and
    excellence.  If someone gives respect, the person receiving \nit might build up
    their self-esteem and in return respect others.  Being \nhonest gains trust and
    sometimes trust can be more valuable than money.  \nWithout communication, walls
    are built and eventually tumble down hurting \neveryone/everything surrounding
    them.  I really applaud your vision on \ncommunication.  Good communication is
    the main ingredient in every view of \nlife.  Keep up the good work.  Striving

    Attention:  John Jay

    IRWIN M. STELZER
    The Sunday Times
    10 December 2000
        Buried deep in an issue of last week's Wall Street Journal is an
    interview with venture capitalist Bill Davidow. As the crash in the value of
    internet companies sours investors, and fills the financial pages with tales
    of impending doom, Mr. Davidow has taken to reminding all who will listen,
    "There was a tulip business even after the tulip mania." Which prompted me to
    dig out my copy of Mike Dash's Tulipomania -- subtitled, "The Story of the
    World's Most Coveted Flower & The Extraordinary Passions It Aroused."
        Davidow is indeed right, and in the post-bubble history of the tulip
    business may lurk some clues as to the history of the dot.coms, many of which
    have been liquidated, while others have seen their values fall by as much as
    90%.
        After the bubble burst, the trade in bulbs did not disappear. Prices
    fell, but in a few years "the trade regain[ed] some sort of equilibrium. The
    speculators had gone, but there was still a market for the flower." But at
    far lower prices, with the specialty bulbs doing better than the garden
    variety tulip. And it is not to stretch the analogy between tulip-growing and
    the dot.com business to cite Dash's observation that "most of the new and
    inexperienced growers who had been attracted by the prospect of rich profits
    gave up the business or were driven out."
        Eventually, bulb growers learned how to turn a profit again. They
    converted their business from a seasonal one to one that could produce all
    year 'round -- something e-tailers have still to learn. They learned how to
    destroy the viruses that periodically destroyed their businesses -- something
    Microsoft et al. have still to learn. They learned how to compete with other
    varieties of flower -- just as e-tailers have been learning how to click with
    bricks-and-mortar retailers.
        In short, although the past is not necessarily prologue, history suggests
    that there indeed life after a bubble bursts. For one thing, investors have
    short memories: the tulipomania was followed by a spurt in the prices of
    hyacinths in the eighteenth century, and by one in dahlias in 1838. Indeed,
    as recently as 1985 prices of the red spider lily soared in China, reaching
    $50,000 for the most coveted varieties, "an amount that puts even the sums
    paid at the height of the Dutch tulip craze to shame", according to Dash.
        More important, the bursting of a bubble separates the wheat from the
    chaff. The fact that the business graveyard is overflowing with the corpses
    of dot.coms tells us less about the future role of the internet in our
    economic lives than it does about the propensity of some to irrational
    exuberance. It should come as no surprise that companies that not only failed
    to earn any money as their customer lists swelled, but touted their mounting
    losses as proof of their success in growing their businesses, should
    eventually fall from investor favour.
        Nor should it be surprising that inexperienced entrepreneurs, whose sole
    lasting contribution to American life has been the destruction of the
    business suit, have discovered that there is more to running a successful
    business than attracting the adulation of equally young and casually clad
    reporters for trade magazines.
        Finally, it should not surprise us that the accumulation of data in this
    era of the so-called "new economy" has led to a more sober appraisal of the
    contribution of new technologies to the ability of the American economy to
    grow without triggering significant inflation. We now know that the massive
    investment in new technologies has increased the rate of growth in
    productivity, and that the economy's speed limit has been raised to something
    closer to 4% than to its old limit of about half that. That's not as
    revolutionary as some of the more strident "new economy" advocates have been
    claiming, but it is enough to make an unemployment rate of only 4%
    sustainable in the long run without setting off a round of wage-price
    inflation.
        What we have, then, is what might be called the residue of the dot.com
    collapse -- a new way of doing business, greater productivity in important
    sectors of the economy, lower transactions costs as buyers and sellers come
    together without the intervention of middlemen, new exchanges in which
    everything from electricity to broadband capacity can be traded efficiently,
    and an increase in consumer power to resist price increases.
        These are permanent changes. The pace at which they are introduced and
    become entrenched will, of course, be affected by the increased volatility of
    share prices. Such volatility, after all, makes investment in shares somewhat
    riskier, which is another way of saying that the price that entrepreneurs
    will have to pay for capital to reward investors for taking these higher
    risks will rise -- indeed, has already risen. But the improvements in
    productivity and efficiency will not be reversed, even if the economy slows
    significantly, as it now is deemed likely to do.
        Perhaps most important of all of our new knowledge is our increased
    understanding of the use of the policy tools available to cope with economic
    downturns. The market soared last week after Federal Reserve chairman Alan
    Greenspan suggested that he was considering lowering interest rates, and the
    Florida courts increased the likelihood that George W. Bush rather than the
    more antibusiness Al Gore would move into the White House when the lease of
    Bill and Hillary Clinton expires next month.
        Investors know that Greenspan can stimulate the economy by lowering
    interest rates, which are high in real terms. After all, as discussed
    elsewhere in these pages, he reversed a far more serious stock market plunge
    in 1997 by easing monetary policy. Investors know, too, that the Bush team
    aims to ease fiscal policy by pushing a tax cut through congress. That
    combination of looser monetary and fiscal policies can go a long way towards
    preventing this slowdown from becoming a recession.

    downturns. The market soared last week after Federal Reserve chairman Alan
    Greenspan suggested that he was considering lowering interest rates, and the
    Florida courts increased the likelihood that George W. Bush rather than the
    more antibusiness Al Gore would move into the White House when the lease of
    Bill and Hillary Clinton expires next month.
        Investors know that Greenspan can stimulate the economy by lowering
    interest rates, which are high in real terms. After all, as discussed
    elsewhere in these pages, he reversed a far more serious stock market plunge
    in 1997 by easing monetary policy. Investors know, too, that the Bush team
    aims to ease fiscal policy by pushing a tax cut through congress. That
    combination of looser monetary and fiscal policies can go a long way towards
    preventing this slowdown from becoming a recession.

  text: "Ken,\n\nIn my pre-Enron life, I taught history (years and years ago).  \n\nRecently,
    while culling files in preparation for moving from EB to 3AC,  I \ncame across
    a pamphlet about the origins of the Transwestern Pipeline Company \nand found
    it very interesting - for the second or third time.\n\nIn particular, I am impressed
    by the vision these pioneers had.  My concern \nis that our Enron preserve some
    record of those early people and days of the \nentities that make up the bigger
    Enron.  They were awesome.\n\nIn another pre-Enron segment of my life, I worked
    for a rare and out-of-print \nbook dealer.  One of the collections we worked hard
    to accumulate and then to \nsell as a collection was a group of business histories.
    \ The collection was \nsnapped up the first month we put it on the market.  Great
    business stories \ngo on and on being researched by and inspiring new generations
    of \nentrepreneurs.\n\nNot having practiced my craft as historian for many years,
    I am no longer \nfamiliar with the important names in historical writing (except
    for popular \nhistorians such as Stephen Ambrose).  If Enron doesn't already have
    a \nhistorian, we need an established writer of substantial stature - someone
    \nwhose produced work would reach a lot of people.  \n\nMaybe someone from the
    Rice University staff could point the way?  Or, maybe \neven someone from Rice
    has the qualities needed to produce an exciting \nhistory of Enron.\n\nBecause
    ours is such a great story, I would like to see a project such as \nthis pursued.
    \ I would like to know what you think about this suggestion.\n\nThanks for letting
    me send this your way.\n\nVera Jones, ETS Project Control\n\n\n\n"

    00000000\n\nClients and friends:\n\n    Nonprofit organizations that maintain
    websites will want to know that the\nIRS is considering regulating nonprofit Web
    speech.  Public comments are\nbeing sought by the IRS on these proposed new rules
    for nonprofits.\n\n\n    The Internal Revenue Service has released \"Announcement
    2000-84\"\nsoliciting public comment on possible new regulations for charities,
    think\ntanks and educational organizations.\n\n\n    Among the questions the IRS
    is addressing in its review of exempt\n\norganization's speech on their Internet
    sites is:\n\n\n\"Does providing a hyperlink on a charitable organization's website
    to\n\nanother organization that engages in political campaign intervention result\n\nin
    per se prohibited political intervention?\"\n\n\n\"To what extent are statements
    made by subscribers to a forum, such as a\n\nlistserv or newsgroup, attributable
    to an exempt organization that\n\nmaintains the forum?\"\n\n\n\"Does a website
    constitute a single publication or communication? If not,\n\nhow should it be
    separated into distinct publications or communications?\"\n\n\nHouse Majority
    Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, has issued a statement\n\ncondemning the IRS' consideration
    of new regulations for the Internet.\n\n\n\"The IRS has no business getting involved
    in whether a think thank has\n\nlinks on its website, or how often a charity's
    site is updated,\" he said.\n\n\"The idea of turning the tax man into a Net cop
    would have a chilling\n\neffect on free speech on the Internet. I'm glad the agency
    has not taken\n\nany regulatory action yet. But let's be clear about this. We
    will be\n\nwatching what they do, and we will not tolerate any backdoor attempt
    to\n\nregulate the Internet.\"\n\n\nThe public comment period on this issue will
    close Feb. 13, 2001, according\n\nto the IRS announcement. Comments are to be
    directed to Judith E. Kindell,\n\nthe principal author of the announcement, at
    the IRS, 1111 Constitution\n\nAvenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20224.\n\nWe hope you

    UNITED STATES-MEXICO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
    Rocky Mountain Regional Chapter
    George P. Heinrich, President
    Gil Cisneros, Senior Regional Director

    THE FOX WATCH!

       1. This IMI presents an overview of what are
    expected to be the environmental priorities for Mexico's new administration.
    The new administration in Mexico has mentioned the following as priority
    areas for development over the next six years.

    -Review the present environmental standards (NOM's). Make changes to
    increase the compliance of micro, small and mid-sized companies.

    -Study ways the private sector can participate in the development of
    infrastructure to treat and dispose of industrial waste. Implement programs
    to facilitate this.

    -Launch special programs for large private consumers of potable water to
    encourage the use of recycled water.

    -Increase federal expenditures on environmental infrastructure along the
    Mexico -U.S. border.


    2. Implications for U.S. companies: U.S. manufacturers of equipment and
    providers of environmental services should be able to increase their market
    share during the next six years because of the priorities mentioned above.

    3. Companies interested in selling equipment and services should contact:

    but it is a pretty big event and would \nreally highlight Enron's recognition
    of Cornell as being a \"Core School\" in \nthe MBA recruiting process.  The event
    as outlined below is scheduled for \nMarch 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.\n\nKevin\n\n-----

    cc: \n\t\t Subject: \n\nKevin-\n\n\nJust a quick follow-up on my November 2 email
    regarding Enron's\nparticipation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week
    and the\npossibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had
    a\nchance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on\nyou
    plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. \nBelow is the
    earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all\nis well with you.\n\n\n
    \           Nov.2 email text\n\n\nWe at Cornell's Johnson School would like to
    establish a stronger link\nwith Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading
    example of the\nagile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable\nmarkets
    of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like\nEnron to consider
    is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic\nOrganizations which draws faculty
    and students from across Cornell and\nbeyond.\n\n\nThe specific activities that
    we propose at this point in time are two. \nFirst, we would like to invite a senior
    leader from Enron to be a key\nspeaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week
    in March, 2001.  As\ndescribed in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made
    up of three\nconferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations
    and\nstudents.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a \"live\ncase
    study\" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,\n2001</underline>.\n\n\nYou,
    of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this\nis the kind
    of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay\nand would give them
    a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and\nthe Cornell community.
    \ Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the\ncorporate conference are
    John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken\nChenault, incoming CEO of American
    Express, Marty Coyne, just announced\nPresident of Kodak's new Commercial Group.
    \ Each of these leaders has a\ndistinct message to deliver about the leadership
    challenges involved in\ncontinually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing
    marketplace.  \n\n\nWe have several other speakers lined up for other parts of
    Leadership\nWeek, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman\nSachs.
    \ We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company\nand an outside
    shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank\nRhodes, but these are
    still long shots.\n\n\nThe point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen
    at the\nJohnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted\na
    platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If\nthey can't
    do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the\ndate is March 28,
    2001.       \n\n\nThe second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along
    the same\nlines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it\ncould
    become the basis for the March conference live case study\npresentation.  We believe
    that Enron is unique in its ability to\nliterally create new markets.  The question
    is how do you lead and manage\nan organization to keep the tight financial and
    risk controls in place\nthat you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior
    that seems to\nbe the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems
    and\npractices make this possible.\n\n\nI know that Enron was the subject of two
    Harvard cases in 1993 and around\n1997.  As I understand it neither focused on
    organizational and\nleadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research
    team to\nbuilding this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee
    Dyer\nfrom the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the\nEnron
    organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast\nmoving organizations
    and are committed to doing this in a very efficient\nway.\n\n\nKevin, we appreciate
    your willingness to entertain these two ideas and\nhopefully test them with your
    top leaders.  We will do anything we can to\nmake it feasible for Enron to engage
    with us on these two initiatives. \nPlease let me know what I can do to help you
    carry this forward.  As\nalways, thanks for your great personal support.\n\n\nDick\n\n\n\n\n\n"

  text: |-
    Ken,

    Soon you will receive (or perhaps have just received) a letter from a fellow
    MU alumnus, Roger Vasey.  In the letter, Roger outlines a business
    opportunity that he believes has a potential synergy with Enron.

    While I am not familiar with this business opportunity, I am very familiar
    with Roger.  He is now semi-retired following a very successful business
    career.  He remains a special advisor to the chairman of Merrill Lynch &
    Co., Inc., in New York.  Previously, he was executive VP and global director
    of all debt markets underwriting, sales, and trading for the firm.

    Since the early 1990s, Roger has been actively involved with MU,
    specifically with the College of Business.  He has served as chair of both
    the Strategic Development Board and the Davenport Society.  Roger also was a
    member of the steering committee for the college's very successful capital
    campaign.  I hold him in the highest regard and feel fortunate that he, like
    you, has chosen to contribute to his undergraduate alma mater in various
    significant ways.

    I hope you will consider the opportunity described in Roger's letter.  I
    know he must think it has a great deal of potential if he decided to present
    it to you.

    Finally, thanks very much for your holiday card and the donation
    opportunity, which benefitted Boys & Girls Club of Columbia in my case.
    Season's greetings,

    Bruce Walker

    12, 2000\n\nWelcome to The Lighthouse, the e-mail newsletter of The Independent
    \nInstitute, the non-partisan, public policy research organization \n<http://www.independent.org>.
    We provide you with updates of the Institute's \ncurrent research publications,
    events and media programs.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIN
    THIS WEEK'S ISSUE:\n1. Pentagon \"Shocked\" to Find Rivers Dammed with Pork\n2.
    The Environmental Propaganda Agency\n3. William Lloyd Garrison, Antislavery Crusader\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPENTAGON
    \"SHOCKED\" TO FIND RIVERS DAMMED WITH PORK\n\nCaptain Louis Renault -- Claude
    Raines's cheerfully duplicitous character in \nthe 1942 film classic \"Casablanca\"
    -- asserted glibly that he was \"shocked, \nshocked\" to learn that gambling was
    taking place at Rick's Cafe. Moments \nlater he was only too happy to collect
    his gambling earnings for the night.\n\nAll this is by way of preamble to a new
    Pentagon investigation of fraud in \nmilitary construction. The investigation
    concluded that three senior Army \nCorps of Engineers officials had, just as one
    whistle-blowing Corps economist \nhad claimed, engaged in a deceitful campaign
    to justify what the Washington \nPost called \"a billion-dollar construction binge
    on the Mississippi and \nIllinois rivers.\"\n\n\"The [Pentagon] investigators
    concluded that the agency's aggressive efforts \nto expand its budget and missions,
    as well as its eagerness to please its \ncorporate customers and congressional
    patrons, have helped 'create an \natmosphere where objectivity in its analyses
    was placed in jeopardy,'\" the \nPost reports.\n\n\"Even the agency's retired
    chief economist told them that Corps studies were \noften 'corrupt,' and that
    several Corps employees cited 'immense pressure' to \ngreen-light questionable
    projects.\"\n\nBureaucratic boondoggles of such magnitude are certainly newsworthy.
    But they \nare hardly news. Just as the Soviets derided the failures of previous
    Five \nYear Plans (only to implement new, equally flawed versions), so it seems
    that \nevery few years the Pentagon uncovers massive corruption and waste in its
    own \ncentrally planned fiefdom -- only to present a new Plan that operates under
    \nthe same bad incentives that encouraged prior malfeasance.\n\nWith corruption
    and waste seemingly \"taken care of,\" the worst pork-barrel \nspenders in Congress
    and the military are then let off the hook, only to \nenjoy -- like Casablanca's
    Renault and Rick -- an amicable toast to the \nbeginnings of a beautiful new friendship.\n\nFor
    the Washington Post series on the Army Corp of Engineers boondoggle, see\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-1.html.\n\nFor
    a summary of the Independent Institute book, ARMS, POLITICS AND THE \nECONOMY:
    Historical and Contemporary Perspectives, edited by Robert Higgs, see\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-2.html.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE
    ENVIRONMENTAL PROPAGANDA AGENCY\n\nWill the neck-to-neck presidential race help
    reduce -- or intensify -- \npressure for the next president of the United States
    to score points with \nstatist environmental activists?\n\nExcept on a few controversial
    issues, a strong case can be made that the \nforty-third President of the United
    States will wish to portray himself as a \nclose friend of \"the environment.\"
    President George W. Bush, for example, \nwould face strong pressure to show that
    he is \"bipartisan\" in his approach to \nenvironmental protection; whereas President
    Al Gore would likely attempt to \nwin back those who supported Nader and the Greens.\n\nAll
    the more reason, then, to call attention to the failures of the current \napproach
    to environmental protection -- especially those emanating from the \nU.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency, or, as economist Craig Marxsen terms \nit, the Environmental
    Propaganda Agency.\n\nThe EPA sometimes employs the language of cost-benefit analysis
    to illustrate \nits seemingly tremendous success, but it is known to employ it
    in a highly \nmisleading manner. The EPA claimed, for example, that its Clean
    Air Act \nprograms produced, from 1970 to 1990, $22.2 trillion dollars in health
    \nbenefits at a cost of only $523 billion. But, reports Marxsen in THE \nINDEPENDENT
    REVIEW, \"[The EPA's] study actually represents a milestone in \nbureaucratic
    propaganda. Like junk science in the courtroom, the study \nseemingly attempts
    to obtain the largest possible benefit figure rather than \nto come as close as
    possible to the truth.\"\n\nIn conclusion, writes Marxsen, \"Without the illusory
    benefit of all the lives \nsaved, the actual benefits of the Clean Air Act were
    very modest and probably \ncould have been achieved nearly as well with far less
    sacrifice. The Clean \nAir Act and its amendments force the EPA to mandate reduction
    of air \npollution to levels that would have no adverse health effects on even
    the \nmost sensitive person in the population. The EPA relentlessly presses forward
    \nin its absurd quest, like a madman setting fire to his house in an insane \ndetermination
    to eliminate the last of the insects infesting it.\"\n\nFor more information,

    REVIEW, Summer 2000), at\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-3.html.\n\nFor
    analysis of other EPA programs, see the Independent Institute book, \nCUTTING

    LLOYD GARRISON, Antislavery Crusader\n\n\"I will be as harsh as truth, and as
    uncompromising as justice. On this \nsubject, I do not wish to think, or speak,
    or write with moderation.... I \nwill not equivocate -- I will not excuse -- I
    will not retreat a single inch \n-- and I will be heard.\"\n     -- William Lloyd
    Garrison, THE LIBERATOR, January 1, 1831\n\nDecember 12 marks the 195th anniversary
    of the birth of William Lloyd \nGarrison, a leading figure in the American abolitionist
    movement. As the late \nhistorian Henry Mayer explained in his National Book Award-Finalist
    \nbiography, ALL ON FIRE: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery:\n\n\"William
    Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879) is an authentic American hero who, with a \nBiblical
    prophet's power and a propagandist's skill, forced the nation to \nconfront the
    most crucial moral issue in its history. For thirty-five years \nhe edited and
    published a weekly newspaper in Boston, THE LIBERATOR, which \nremains today a
    sterling and unrivaled example of personal journalism in the \nservice of civic
    idealism.\n\n\"Although Garrison -- a self-made man with a scanty formal education
    -- \nconsidered himself 'a New England mechanic' and lived outside the precincts
    \nof the American intelligentsia, he nonetheless did the hard intellectual work
    \nof challenging orthodoxy, questioning public policy, and offering a luminous
    \nvision of a society transformed. He inspired two generations of activists --
    \nfemale and male, black and white -- and together they built a social movement
    \nwhich, like the civil rights movement of our own day, was a collaboration of
    \nordinary people, stirred by injustice and committed to each other, who \nachieved
    a social change that conventional wisdom first condemned as wrong \nand then ridiculed
    as impossible.\"\n\nIndeed, without Garrison's inflammatory but compelling writing,
    speaking and \norganizing, there might have been no effective American anti-slavery
    movement \nat all.\n\nFor more on William Lloyd Garrison, read historian Henry
    Mayer's talk from \nthe Independent Policy Forum, \"The Civil War: Liberty and
    American Leviathan\" \n(with Jeffrey Rogers Hummel), at\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-6.html,

  subject: IRS Tax Determination Letter
  text: |-
    Jim:

    Thank you for your communication advising as to the concern that the IRS
    seems to have about non-profits and the internet.  In early February of
    this year I filed a form 1023 seeking a tax determination letter for
    "Technology For All" a Texas non-profit corporation whose mission it is
    to enhance the educational and economic opportunities of the
    disadvantaged ("TFA").  TFA has a strong board led by Ken Lay, the CEO
    of Enron Corporation.  TFA has assisted its affiliates (all believed to
    be tax exempt non profits) in building computer learning centers
    ("CLC's") where recycled computers and donated software are connected
    over the Enron Broadband Network (donated to TFA) to a server farm that
    delivers to the disadvantaged at the CLC's educational and other
    content.  There are over 75 CLC's in Houston, some 25 in Colorado and we
    are building affiliations that will build them across the country and
    eventually all over the world.  The business plan for this contemplates
    operations in excess of one billion by the end of five years.  However,
    we have not yet received our tax determination letter.  We have found
    that major contributors require a tax determination letter.

        I received a response from the IRS on May 3, 2000.  On May 11, 2000,
    I responded with answers to the inquiries made by the IRS.  Then on June
    8 I was advised that our application had been sent to the national
    office.  On November 15 I received another letter from the IRS raising
    some additional questions unrelated to the first response.  While there
    were some that were of substance in the main they were pretty weak.  The
    first question was something like "What did we mean by disadvantaged?"

        My question to you is what do you think is best to get this going
    and out of the IRS?  Should I ask our board members to use their
    considerable political influence tocause the IRS to move this?  Back in
    August I had Bill Archer give the Commissioner an invitation to finish
    this.  It did not seem to work.  I do not wish for an effort on my part
    to cause this to go to the bottom of some bureaucrats stack.     Your

  subject: 'Re: IRS Tax Determination Letter'
  text: "Jack:\n\n    We routinely work with applications that have been \"sent to
    the national\noffice.\"  If an application is \"sent to the national office,\"
    it means that\nan issue or issues have been identified in the application by the
    original\nreviewing agent that give the agent pause, and which the agent feels
    a more\ntechnical review by a more skilled agent is required.  It always means
    that\nthere is some problem with the application that could result in denial of
    the\napplication.\n\n    I suspect that what the IRS would really like your client
    to do is\nestablish objective standards in your organization's fundamental documents\nfor
    determining who is to receive the assistance of the charity.   Such\nstandards
    would give the IRS assurance that only poor people would receive\nthe benefits,
    and make it easier to determine if the mission was being\nadhered to in an audit
    of activities.  Addressing this concern could be as\nsimple as enacting a Bylaw
    amendment or more likely an amendment to the\nArticles of Incorporation.\n\n    Last
    year, our office was brought in at the \"national office\" stage, well\nafter
    the Form 1024 was filed, to help a group of ranchers and cattlemen in\nWyoming/Montana
    opposed to illegal imports of below cost beef, to obtain\ntrade association status,
    (501(c)(6)), that the national office kept trying\nto deny by saying they were
    an agriculture organization (which meant\npotentially less availability of tax
    deductible contributions under o162).\nWhat we did in that case was setup a conference
    call with the client's\nlawyers and the IRS national office team assigned to the
    file.  We talked\nthrough the application, identified each and every problem the
    IRS had\nidentified, and then our firm prepared, in essence, a supplemental brief\naddressing
    each issue.  In the process, we learned that a few minor changes\nto the Articles
    of Incorporation and Bylaws, plus the supplemental\napplication information, were
    enough to address the IRS's agents concerns,\nand they issued the tax determination
    letter.\n\n    Thus, I would suggest that you request a conference call with the\nnational
    office agent or \"team\" reviewing the application, and get them to\nidentify
    each and every concern with the application.   Then, ask them for a\nperiod of
    time to respond.  Ask them if changes in the fundamental corporate\ndocuments
    would help address their concerns.  And of course, be mindful that\nif you have
    had ongoing activities, you will want to be sure that anything\nyou do will result
    in retroactive deductibility for what contributions you\nhave already received.\n\n
    \   During late 1999, the IRS was accused of responding to political pressure\nin
    triggering audits of exempt organizations by the Landmark Legal\nFoundation, a
    conservative, Washington, D.C. legal foundation.  Landmark did\na Freedom of Information
    Act request and released documents which tended to\nindicate that the IRS was
    auditing groups in response to complaints from\nCongressmen.  The IRS denied that
    political influence plays a role in its\ndecisions, and, since then, the IRS exempt
    organizations unit has been very\ncareful about not creating an impression that
    they respond to political\npressure.\n\n    If your client would like our firm
    to help as a consultant to work with\nthe national office, we'd be pleased to
    be of assistance.  We would need to\nreview the file and have your client execute
    a Form 2848 Power of Attorney\nfor us to join the team.\n\n    Hope this is helpful.\n\nBest

    Ken,

    Houston's bid for the 2012 Olympic Games is entering the final phase of the
    domestic bid process.  This summer, the United States Olympic Committee
    (USOC) will conduct initial site visits and evaluations of the eight U.S.
    bid cities with the goal being to cut the number of cities to three or four.
    This cut will occur in December of this year.  The USOC will be conducting
    Houston's site visit July 16-19, 2001.

    This site visit is critical to our ultimate success in bringing the Olympic
    Games to Houston.  Over the four-day period in which the USOC site
    evaluation team is in Houston, two days will be devoted to venue tours and
    presentations.  There are eight presentation topics predetermined by the
    USOC, one of which is International Strategy. Simply stated, this is where
    we show why we think Houston can win on the international level.

    As a Port Commissioner and a board member of Houston 2012, I will be part of
    the team that presents this section to the USOC site evaluation team.  As
    arguably the most identifiable international corporate leader in Houston and
    as the Chairman of the 1990 Economic Summit and the 1992 Republican National
    Convention, both of which you left with a positive surplus (very important
    to the Olympics), you are in an excellent position to discuss Houston's
    international status.

    George DeMontrond, Susan Bandy (the Houston 2012 Exec Director) and I would
    very much appreciate 15 minutes or so of your time to update you on
    Houston's bid efforts and discuss your potential participation in the
    upcoming site visit. You are our first and only choice, and I'd like the
    opportunity to show you how important this is for Houston. We expect the
    number of U.S. bid cities to be reduced to four finalists by this December
    as a result of these meetings.  I will call Rosalee to schedule a time for a
    visit at your offices. All the best and I look forward to catching up with
    you soon. I'm attaching my bio, which details the last few years of activity
    I've been involved with, most of which emanated from your support for me on
    the UH Board of Regents, the 1990 Economic Summit Host Committee, the 1992
    RNC Convention and later the GHP. Thank you for everything you've done for
    Sarah and me -- hopefully I've reciprocated by doing a good job for you each
    time.

    PW.? We have about another $5 million  available with a little \nbit of cushion.?
    I also spoke with Rocky about how  they arrive at their loan \nto value calculations
    and he is going to have me talk  with the person in \nthat department to walk
    me through it.? Regardless of  how much that number \nmoves, I told Sherrie that
    you would like to know where it  stands at the \ntime she provides the information
    for all of the other  lines.? I told her \nthat we should have that updated once
    a  week.\n?\nI also?thought it would be good?within  the?partnership to borrow
    against the \nPW accounts, which include Fayez,  Cypress, Eagle, and Harris Bretall
    for \nsome of these private investments.?  The combined gross value is at $2.5
    \nmillion so that would allow for an  additional $1.25 million to be borrowed
    \nat 50% loan to value.? It may be a  higher number, but with a small cushion
    \nthat is probably a good estimate.?  I talked to Rocky about this and he said
    \nit would be no problem and he would  give us the same rate 70 basis points.\n?\nWith
    regards to rates and the PW/UBS merger, Rocky  said that he thinks that \nhe can
    get our borrowing rate down from 70 basis points  plus LIBOR to 20 \nbasis points
    plus LIBOR come this November when the merger is  completed.\n?\nI have Rocky
    working on much better reports, like  that which was provided to \nbe by Mueller/O'Shaughnessy
    at MSDW.? I told him  that they needed to work on \nwhat they have?been providing
    to me.? I  have not been impressed with the \nlast couple of reports he has produced
    so that  is why you haven't seen \nthem.? Rocky informed me that?he has sense
    \ gone out and purchased a better \nsystem for that purpose.\n?\nI also told him
    that I would like an update on the  performance reports that \nare run on managers,
    specifically ours.?  Also,?I am having him include \nmanagers that invest in Latin
    America.?  I though it would be good, since \nRobert Day of TCW has been positive
    about  that?geographic area.\n?\nWith regards to any future selling of personal
    \ Enron stock, Rocky recommends \nselling within your?retirment plan since the
    \ taxes are deferred and \ndiversify within it.? Maybe set-up some of the  managed
    accounts here.? I \ninquired about the Enron 401(k) plan?with  regards to any
    additional choices \nto be offered.? He said that he?was  in talks with the people
    at Enron who \nhandle it, but nothing would probably  happen anytime soon.? I
    don't know if \nthat meant he was implying a need for  a push from?Enron's upper

    and Nagoya Japan, as well as several other US cities as of April 1, 2001.
    They will have 15 flights a day to 5 cities, down from 24 flights a day to
    12 cities.  Included in the cut list are flights to San Francisco, Las
    Vegas, Los Angeles, and New York.  Following is the statement I am releasing
    to the media today about my disappointment about the situation this leaves
    us in and my plans to look for alternate carriers.

    To be removed from the "E-Katz" distribution list, simply reply to this
    e-mail with your request.  If you have multiple e-mail addresses you use,
    please include a name and/or company, otherwise we may not be able to locate
    the correct entry to remove.  For more information on the Katz
    administration, visit our website at http://www.ci.portland.or.us/mayor.



    "I am very disappointed by today's announcement.  This is a big loss for
    Portland, and it will have a lasting effect on our economy.

    "Perhaps because of the current strong economy, Portlanders have
    consistently rated efforts to 'grow as an international city' lowest on
    their list of priorities.  Still, as Mayor I worked long and hard with Delta
    over the last ten years and fought for their routes to Osaka and Fukuoka,
    because I felt strongly that Portland's future was in being an international
    city.  Portland will not continue to thrive if we accept doing business only
    within the confines of our city limits.  With the high tech economy of today
    and the reach of the internet, we must reach across borders.

    "That's why I've led efforts to create business strategies --
    Internationalizing Greater Portland I & II -- which focused on air and trade
    connections because our business partners are no longer just on the other
    side of town, or even the other side of the state.  We are competing in
    markets around the world, and with Delta's decision we are losing an
    important link to our partners and friends in Asia.  We also stand to lose
    connections to major cities right here in the U.S.

    "While I understand the economics of this decision -- the unexpected
    downturn in the Asian economy, the continuing problems with the INS --  I
    have learned something from our Asian partners over the years and that is
    the importance of investing in relationships.

    "Next week we will open the finest classical Chinese garden outside of
    China.  Our goal is to create an atmosphere in Portland where people from
    other countries feel comfortable doing business with us because we honor
    their culture.

    "This sets us back nearly 15 years -- 15 years of promoting Portland to
    Asian cities from Sapporo to Seoul.  My mission now is to work hard to
    ensure it doesn't take us that long to recover.

    "I will be working with our partners in the business community, the Port,
    our congressional delegation, and the Governor's office to look at
    alternative providers for Asian service. We may have opportunities because
    of the state of flux in the airlines industry.  I will also be asking for
    more local support for our international efforts.  I have met with
    representatives from other cities, and have been looking at the Seattle and
    Amsterdam models of promoting their cities internationally.

    "Further, I will also be pushing Delta to re-examine its New York route.
    This is the 12th largest flight out of PDX, carrying 200,000 people
    annually.  It's a route critical to our major retailers and financial
    institutions."

    Ken-Here is a first cut at a spread sheet for the distributions necessary to
    return at lease $100,000 to everyone so no partner will have to put up any
    new money.  Have you heard from Texaco or BFI? Also, Marathon committed to
    the roll over, but not the referendum.  You may need to make a call to
    Marathon to see if you can convince them on the referendum.  Conoco also
    only committed to their proportionate part, probably about $50,000, for the
    referendum and Don Sanders said he would commit $50,000 toward the
    referendum.  We, therefore could have only $1 million from the partners on
    the referendum if Marathon, Texaco and BFI don't contribute.  We do have
    $100,000, however, from Reliant.  Moreover, without Sanders, BFI and
    possibly Texaco, we may have only around $30 million to rollover into the
    loan.  As soon as we can the final answers from all of the partners we will
    be able to finalize the term sheet with the Sports Authority and get the
    advance payment on the loan.  I still haven't heard from Goldberg on the
    term sheet with the Rockets.

    industry magazines.  Enron is mentioned but not interviewed so I didn't know
    if you would have access to a copy.

    Cut and paste:
    Video on the Move
    Dropping costs and rising competition are forcing operators to see
    video-on-demand in a whole new light
    BY SIMON APPLEBAUM
    At VOD programmer Diva, the deployment forecast gets more specific, as does
    the rationale behind why operators will push the action. Three factors come
    into play:
    * DBS penetration continues to fly and bite off operators' best customers;
    * the plunging expense of video-server hardware and video-stream
    transmissions, which make moot the big, prohibitive load operators have used
    to justify not deploying VOD;
    * the fallout from Time Warner's deal to merge with America Online --
    namely, considerable encouragement to accelerate plans in every other
    convergence direction they want to travel, be it digital cable services
    (including near-VOD and tiers), high-speed Web surfing through cable modems,
    or interactive TV.
    Thus with cost and infrastructure concerns put aside, and competition
    staring them in the face, operators see VOD in a new light. Now that DBS
    reaches 13 million subs "and is heading for 20 million, cable is feeling the
    pain," says Diva president David Zucker. "Every one of the eight largest
    cable operators, every single one, will deploy or trial VOD in some manner.
    The big rollouts will start the second half of the year." If they come, they
    may hear another set of competitive footsteps entering the scene. Digital
    subscriber line carriers such as SBC and Qwest, hunting for high-speed
    Internet households, are poised to reach out and become must-see VOD TV
    through Viacom subsidiary Blockbuster. With infrastructure help from Enron
    Broadband Services, Blockbuster will deploy a movies-driven VOD service in a
    number of cities by December, and all over the U.S. next year. The joint
    venture will go after cable and DBS distribution, but off the bat, DSL will
    be in the driver's seat, as routed through SBC, Qwest and other suppliers.
    But right now, reality is nowhere near the perception Jacobsen and Zucker
    suggest. Few multi-system owners have VOD formats fully deployed or in
    trial; most MSOs don't, even though they are deep in digital-service
    launches incorporating near-VOD, which takes up 30 channels or more of a
    system's lineup. Video-on-demand, on the other hand, uses far fewer channels
    than NVOD, because video servers, placed at or near the system's headend,
    store the programming and transmit it on addressable command from
    subscribers, any time, over streaming transmissions. How high is the payoff
    for mass cable adoption? Try 40 to 60 percent, by 2010, of the multi-billion
    dollar revenue pot home-video companies enjoy now, predicted Merrill Lynch
    senior media analyst Jessica Reif-Cohen at the recent Myers interactive-TV
    forum in New York.
    Where the Action Is
    You need more than one hand to count the number of VOD projects happening
    around the country, but you don't need many more. Here's the scorecard:
     * Diva - VOD's veteran packager is doing full-deployment business in at
    least 10 areas. Affiliates include AT&T Broadband in Marin County, Calif.
    (outside San Francisco) and Atlanta (formerly MediaOne turf); Charter
    Communications in the Atlanta suburbs; and a growing number of Insight
    Communications locales (Columbus, Ohio; Rockford, Ill.; and Evansville,
    Ind.) where VOD is bundled with Source Media's Local Source interactive-TV
    service. Before Labor Day, Charter will add Diva to at least one of its Los
    Angeles-area systems. More than 400 titles, from movie blockbusters to
    special-interest videos, are available each month. Top films go for $3.95 a
    pop, while classic flicks and other titles get priced at $2.95 or below.
    Available attractions include library shows from ESPN, TNT, Discovery and
    other cable nets. About 15,000 subs use the service at least once a month.
     * Time Warner - Cable's second-largest operator is in full VOD blast,
    following a trial run in Austin, Texas, last summer. Honolulu became the
    first Time Warner locale to make VOD available system-wide earlier this
    year, covering about 250,000 subs. Tampa, Fla., turned on in June, according
    to Concurrent Computer, which provides servers and streaming tech to Time
    Warner. About 100,000 Tampa-area subs are getting their day in the VOD sun.
    * Intertainer - After two years of development and tests, the VOD player
    that includes Microsoft, Comcast, NBC, Sony and Intel among its equity
    stakeholders will soon premiere in Comcast's suburban Baltimore system. That
    follows DSL rollouts in U S West's Denver enterprise and Cincinnati under an
    independent franchiser. The service has plenty of interactive features to
    accompany the content, including opportunities to order an artist's CD after
    watching his music video; local information retrieval; and e-commerce
    choices. Intertainer CEO Jonathan Taplin promises a "stunning"
    MSO-affiliation announcement over the next few weeks.
    * In Demand - PPV's kingpin player was already talking to affiliates about
    VOD rollouts and trials when new president Stephen Brenner assumed his post
    earlier this summer (see sidebar, p. 30).
    * TVN - In Demand's closest PPV/NVOD rival, whose affiliate base consists of
    mid-size and small system owners, is in the midst of several VOD technical
    and marketing trials. Some rollout announcements are expected early this
    fall. Like Diva and Intertainer, TVN wants to combine programming with
    interactive applications.
     * DemandVideo - This California-based firm surfaced this spring, initially
    on a quest for cable overbuilder affiliates so that they wouldn't be absent
    from VOD activity. Seren Innovations (which runs its systems under Astound
    Cable TV) and Knology signed up before the National Cable TV Association
    convention, and Seren put Demand's format through a 25-home trial in St.
    Cloud, Minn. But at NCTA's show in May, Demand CEO Rajiv Juluria insisted
    that his product will be available to all comers, entrenched or encroacher.
    Knology will launch the service among hotels in Panama City, Fla., while
    Seren commits to a full St. Cloud rollout, plus deployment in Contra Costa
    County, Calif.
    * E-Video TV - A new VOD player out of Scottsdale, Ariz., E-Video has
    developed download technology through which digital cable subs can retrieve
    feature films, programming and interactive games. Roy Bennett, E-Video's
    president, says his firm will try the process out with a cable operator
    before summer ends.
    Up ahead in the player pipeline: StreamBox and AlwaysonTV.com, two ventures
    running both video and Internet content. Both exhibited two months ago at
    Streaming Media East in New York. Within VOD's own tech vendordom --
    companies that provide video servers and program-insertion gear to operators
    -- there's growing consensus that the on-demand era launches this fall. How
    fast VOD takes off is more in the hands of set-top box providers than MSOs,
    believes Concurrent CEO Steve Nussrallah. The sooner they flood the scene
    with digital converters, the sooner deployments happen.  "We're at the front
    door of an explosion. Late fall or early next year is the right time for
    this market to happen," he says. "The only thing holding the market back is
    the ability of set-top vendors to build and ship their product at a level
    equal to the demand. By the end of 2004, we should be north of 30 million
    digital set-tops, with the vast majority of them VOD-enabled. Deployment by
    operators becomes a no-brainer." AOL Time Warner will push operators into
    deployment decisions, adds nCube president Michael Pohl. "The convergence of
    Time Warner's content with the broadband opportunities AOL looks at will
    drive the content and availability of content for VOD," Pohl suggests.
    "Movies are OK and great, probably a good place to start, but ultimately,
    viewers want to go to their operator and ask for whatever they want to see."
    "You see the operators showing excitement for VOD now, as opposed to the
    vendors showing excitement, which is what it was for the last few years,"
    says Yvette Gordon, interactive technologies VP at SeaChange Technologies.
    "The AOL-Time Warner merger helps."
    The Naysayers
    But many people don't buy it. Take Playboy Television -- they're supplying
    product to selected Diva and Time Warner VOD markets. They're in the game,
    but Playboy TV president Jim English doesn't look for a breakout market
    until 2002. Why? Despite big declines in server cost, "you need so many per
    state, so many per [sub universe]," English reasons. "The more subs on the
    line, the slower the traffic goes. It's still very expensive electronics.
    I'm not trying to poke holes at anyone, but a lot of projections about this
    industry didn't come out as advertised. How many years did it take for
    digital cable to move? Even now, operators have more trucks dedicated to
    installing high-speed cable modems than digital cable. And on cable's agenda
    priority scale, just getting the digital box in is number one." For
    Susquehanna Communications and Classic Cable, 2001 is the year VOD will make
    it to their systems, provided the tech issues English raises get resolved.
    As big as the case is for getting economics down enough for deployment among
    large MSOs, it's magnified several times over for owners the size of
    Susquehanna and Classic.  "Insight, for example, can serve tens or hundreds
    of thousands of customers from a single headend. The best we can do is 7,000
    customers from a single headend. For the small, non-metro markets we
    service, how do you amortize the cost for initial equipment installation?"
    asks Classic CEO Merritt Belisle. "When you take into account the
    flexibility and long-term viability of the tech, and different content
    avenues, there's a lot that's nascent and in development," responds Dan
    Templain, Susquehanna's corporate marketing/programming director. "The
    content and the tech have to become compelling enough to consumers that
    we're willing to roll it out." Still, Templain's company is determined to do
    a field trial somewhere this fall, and get deployment underway before the
    end of next March. "That's accelerated thinking from where we were six
    months ago." To SVOD or Not to SVOD? On the programming side, the train
    everyone wants to be aboard is making VOD a diverse medium, perhaps to the
    point where the medium should be relabeled "COD" -- for content-on-demand.
    Movies, available at or earlier than home-video release, lead the way, but
    not far behind are sports, live/taped events from all over, how-to and
    special-interest videos, children's fare, games, adult entertainment and a
    few genres spun out of the imagination of others.  "There may be
    localized-content opportunities," chirps In Demand's Jacobsen. "Local
    theater, high school football games with real community value." In a COD
    world, "you're not limited to video product," says TVN senior business
    development VP Jim Riley. "Eventually, you download computer software so you
    can view it on your TV as well as on your PC. That's where we're driving
    some of our development energies." TVN's vehicle is Chromazone, involving
    California-based venture capitalist Digital Evolution. From the start,
    Intertainer has embraced a link of COD with interactive elements. "If MSOs
    make the investment in VOD, they must maximize it with advertising,
    e-commerce and all sorts of interactivity," says Jonathan Taplan,
    Intertainer's president and CEO. "That's the ultimate promise. If you think
    about the capital investment and the possible return in gross revenues, like
    $20 a sub per month, that's a damn good business." Diva, infused with $9
    million earlier this summer from operating system/middleware players OpenTV
    and Liberate Technologies (CV, 7/17/00, p. 98), now has economic backing to
    pursue its own interactive-integration course. And soon, cable operators
    will see if their VOD future should incorporate subscription
    video-on-demand, or SVOD. Encore Media Group, under CEO John Sie, is betting
    a substantial chunk of its future on it, and in a matter of weeks, AT&T
    Broadband's newly acquired Atlanta system (off the completed MediaOne
    merger) will test SVOD out using Encore, Starz! and Encore's multiplex
    movies. Here's the SVOD deal, as Sie explains it: Premium service subs, for
    an extra fee, get 20-30 titles running on that service that month on-demand,
    with VCR functionality. The subs watch those films whenever they want, as
    many times as they want, for that one fee. Six or eight dollars a month will
    do. "We're using VOD as a viewer enhancement platform," Sie insists. "Movies
    will drive things first. Once they drive penetration, you can do
    subscription news-on-demand and other things on-demand." Lately, Sie's SVOD
    advocacy comes framed inside a clarion call to move operators in the
    direction of all-digital system conversion. Direct broadcast satellite
    services are that way now, and Sie believes cable system owners have two
    years at most to make that transition, contrary to the seven-to-10-year
    timeframe other industry execs predict. "You know and I know consumer demand
    for digital far exceeds set-top box availability, as well as the supply of
    installation crews. DBS realized that and now they're ramping up," Sie
    believes. But opponents find two flaws in SVOD: Because the product is
    available in the premium window, six months or more after PPV availability,
    there may not be as much audience demand for it compared to pre-PPV.
    Independent of audience demand, there's the specter of cannibalization,
    where on-demand use comes at the expense of premium-channel viewing. "Here's
    a way to enhance and optimize premium services," Nussrallah concludes. "If
    you get constant access to the programming, it's more customer-friendly, and
    something DBS can't provide. Cable is built on the concept that the audience
    buys more if they have more choice and convenience. It may be the next
    opportunity window." Not so, Taplin figures. "It would be cool to get all of
    The Sopranos on a VOD package. But why would people who already see movies
    on premium pay for more of those same movies, after they've had the chance
    to watch those movies in an on-demand way. Unless Sie prices it so low, or
    unless they like those movies a lot, why would they pay again? The flat-fee
    model is a great model, like cellular-phone pricing. People love paying one
    fee for unlimited monthly use. But the window isn't the right window." Sie
    defends SVOD as an enhancement option. "Would an operator launch digital
    cable with pay TV only and not launch PPV, concluding that PPV cannibalizes
    pay, or vice versa? No, because they complement each other beautifully. Same
    here." Other VOD programmers and tech vendors will pursue SVOD experiments.
    TVN is investigating one or more affiliate partnerships for a test. Classic
    and Susquehanna are open to proposals. "What John says is super. What does
    it cost me? I've got a stock market and bond market to work with," Belisle
    says.
    Stream Thinking
    Susquehanna exec Templain calls SVOD "a work in progress platform." Others
    say the same about streamed video content, another pot worthy of industry
    exploitation. "Spectacular" may be the most accurate adjective for the
    assortment of video Internet sites have streamed to PC households
    everywhere, from quirky animation to short films to news clips. More
    diverse, longer streamed content is coming down the pike. Will the very same
    tech making mass VOD deployment possible now also make possible a new
    original content pipe? What an ironic circumstance. Check in with the sites
    themselves, from Real Networks on down, and the masterminds behind them
    point to TV and cable display as their final destination. Fifty million PCs,
    more than 100 million TV homes, almost 70 percent of them cabled -- the
    market's obvious to them. In the end, that's the ticket, cable execs concur.
    But for the near term, no. The broadcast quality's not there yet (although
    tech strides are happening), and there's considerable fear that producers
    will use streaming to bypass cable nets. Gordon targets mid to late 2001 as
    the point where streamed content will be TV/VOD-suitable. Assuming the
    industry locks its fears away, nCube's Pohl sides with the crowd awaiting
    "this kind of ubiquitous media, where things go to the TV or PC." "We're
    sleeping fine at night about this, because the quality is not there yet,"
    adds Diva's Zucker. "But we will make video streaming a Holy Grail for TV in
    the next few years, and cable will be uniquely positioned to take advantage
    of it." *

  text: "Ken/Joe,  As I was walking back to my office reflecting on our conversation,
    \nthere are three points that I mentioned but I think got lost in the \ndiscussion.\n\n1)
    \ This needs to be a stock deal to avoid Indian tax (48%), poorly written \npreferential
    purchase language and gov't approval.  (Still requires RBI \napproval)  All of
    the numbers I have in the document assume a stock \ntransaction. \n\n2) RIL is
    very tax advantaged, currently and for the foreseeable future they \nwill be in
    an NOL position;  therefore, at the numbers we are discussing they \nshould see
    this as an unleveraged return opportunity of 16% (stock purchase \nfully taxed
    with no basis) to 27% (stock purchase shielded from taxes-- Btax \nscenario).
    \  Again, the tax position makes RIL unique for this transaction \nand a very
    likely buyer at these numbers.  Few other parties will be as \npositioned to consider
    a stock transaction of a company with minimal Indian \nbasis, accept the operational
    conditions and be able to close as quickly.  \n\n 3) The idea of coupling the
    other India assets with the E&P is a good \nstrategy if your goal is to ultimately
    sale, but time is unimportant.   I've \ndone multi-asset deals before with a major
    and the bureaucracy rivals India.  \nThe due diligence on the multiple assets
    will eliminate any chance of closing \nthis year. In fact, I would be surprised
    if we could even get a PSA signed \nbefore year-end on a multi-asset deal, plus
    the gov't approvals become more \ncomplex.  \n\n If the goal is money in the door
    before 12/31/00,  I favor a buy/sell at \nKen's number.  If we go to October and
    don't get the documents in place we \nreally haven't lost anything because there
    is little likelihood of closing \nunder a traditional scenario even if we start
    today.   We will prepare our \ndataroom while the negotiations on the documents
    take place and be ready to \nbring in bidders by October. If we buy at these numbers
    I believe we can flip \nthe deal within 6-9 months if not sooner since we have
    operatorship, critical \nmass a major would covet, only one partner and Reliance
    is not a partner.  \n\nAlso,  If we elect to go to a traditional auction, I would
    strongly suggest \nwe keep the E&P separate from the other India assets, at least
    initially, to \nrun the auction with the best chance of getting a PSA signed before
    \nyear-end.   We can always combine them at a later date during negotiations \nonce
    we see how the process is going.  Too many pieces right out of the box \nwill
    be very cumbersome and time consuming.  If we have to combine them to \nget interest,
    we can do it as we see the need for an enhancement.\n \n\nMy final thought, if
    we do an outright sale to RIL ( not a pre-negotiated \nbuy/sell with stipulated
    closing dates,,, etc.) they will want to do a \ncertain amount of due diligence
    and rightfully so.   They would expect and \nprobably demand the same considerations
    as any other buyer including a \ndataroom visit to pick our brains one more time.
    \ Again this becomes a time \nissue!!  Under the buy/sell scenario we have devised,
    there is no due \ndiligence period, the structure of the deal is stipulated and
    everything is \nhandled via representations and warranties in the pre-negotiated
    PSA.     \n\n\nLet me know how and when you wish to proceed.   I will pursue with
    complete \ndedication whichever option you select.\n\nThanks for the time to share
    my thoughts,\njeff"

    Dear Dad,

    I just sent in an additional contribution to the Bush
    Campaign and I put your number on the check, but I
    want you to be aware so that you can assure it is
    credited to your fundraising efforts.
    Secondly, I've been doing a little more research on
    the elusive Discover Communications, INC., my personal
    dream company.
    They are owned by: Liberty Media Corporations, Cox
    Communications, Advance/ Newhouse Communications and
    John S. Hendricks (who is the founder, Chairman and
    CEO). If you know of any of the above companies or any
    possible contact, I would greatly appreciate your
    assistance. I am sending my resume to the Discover HR
    people, but there are very few job postings and
    anything I might be able to do to distinguish myself,
    beyond of course my incredible experience, charm and
    good nature, would be helpful!
    Thanks Dad!

  text: "Ken,  I thought it would be better if I typed my thoughts for you since my
    \nhand writing can be somewhat difficult to read. \n\nBefore you decide the methodology
    for moving our project beyond the D. Ambani \nphone call, I would like to share
    a few thoughts that I believe reduces the \nrisk of Enron being an E&P buyer.
    \ I know the implications of making a large \nE&P purchase are far greater than
    just the cash requirement, but I believe \nwith the following changes to the plan
    presented yesterday and a little 3rd \nparty information, you may feel more comfortable
    making this decision.  Under \nthe buy/sell arrangement a small risk of buying
    will always be present, but I \nbelieve the risk reward ratio in this case has
    very strong merit.  My goals \nfor Enron are three fold; a) sale the assets, b)
    get cash in the door before \nyear-end, and c) get fair value for the assets given
    the current situation.  \nMy comments touch upon five topics:\n\n1)  Reverse the
    buy/sell process giving Enron the control vote\n2)  Pay the Penalty\n3) Contact
    someone at the Janus Fund to talk about Reliance's Financial \ncondition\n4) Thoughts
    on non-Reliance bidder's\n5) Information and the future process\n\nReverse the
    Buy/Sell Process:   The plan outlined yesterday using the \nbuy/sell scenario
    is the best scenario for achieving all of our goals.  The \nrisk for Enron which
    is most troubling is the possibility of being a buyer \nversus a desire to be
    a seller.  I firmly believe if we make one change to \nthe plan as described below,
    we can increase our probability of a successful \nsale to near 100%.  If we don't
    use a but/sell arrangement I am concerned \nthat we will not get fair value or
    cash in the door this year.   In fact, I \nsuspect we will elect not to sell because
    of contract or valuation problems, \nwhich in effect leave us with a stranded
    asset and a lot of employee \nproblems.   \n\nWhen you talk with Dhirubhai we
    can propose the buy/sell concept  with RIL \nmaking the first bid to purchase.
    \ Enron then has the right to sell at that \nprice or increase the bid by 5% and
    RiL must sell.  Since we are now in the \ncontrol position the 10% tax logic we
    talked about yesterday no longer is \nvalid, so I would describe the 5% as a control
    premium.  The only reason we \nwant the buy option is in the event they offer
    a very low number.  I would \nsuspect them to bid in the $550 to $650 million
    range.  They just turned down \nmy offer to purchase their assets at $450mm and
    indicated we were \nsubstantially below their value when I tried to engage them
    in a dialogue.  \nThey know Enron paid $620 million just 12 months ago for the
    same position.  \nWe know they internally have reserves booked higher than ours
    and have a \nstrong desire to have a substantial upstream position that they can
    control.  \nIt is possible that RIL would bid less than $500 million but I put
    that \nprobability at less than one percent.  This reduces Enron's risk dramatically
    \nand increases our probability of getting all of our objectives met. We also
    \nget an added benefit, from pitching the deal with RIL as the first bidder,  \nbecause
    this will  strengthen the perception that we (Enron) want to be the \nbuyer, which
    is a key perception to have a fair auction with only one \nlegitimate buyer, Reliance.
    \ \n\nIf we  pitch the deal as suggested above,  we need to recognise going in
    that \nthey probably want the control position as well.  I believe they would
    pay a \nvery large value for these assets due to their tax position and by bidding
    \nfirst they take great risk of leaving a lot of money on the table or not \ngetting
    the deal at all.   I would suspect that they will at a minimum \nsuggest we flip
    a coin to see who bids first.  Initially I would just say no, \nbut we may need
    to deal with this issue and probably should decide early on \nif it is a deal
    killer.  If we did flip a coin, we would wait until the \ndocuments were final
    and the escrow agreement was signed so there would be no \nbacking out without
    a penalty.  In this scenario it would actually help get a \nmore impartial document
    done quicker if neither party knew the bidding \nsequence until after the drafting
    was finalized.\n\nPay the Penalty: While it is not the way we want to do business,
    the worst \ncase scenario under the proposed escrow agreement is to forfeit  $25
    million \nif we elected not to follow through in an Enron  buy scenario.   Considering
    \nthe upside to the buy/sell under either sequence (Enron first or RIL first)
    \nit may be worth the risk of losing the escrow under a black Friday scenario.
    \ \nI want to think about this over the weekend, but while I was thinking this
    \nafternoon the risk reward seems to be very favorable.  \n\nContact someone at
    Janus Fund:  This was suggested yesterday and I would \nstrongly urge you to do
    this if you feel comfortable making the inquiry.  \nJanus bought approximately
    a  5% position in RIL about 1-2 months ago.  I \nthink you will get a very positive
    report on both the cash front and their \ndesire to make the upstream a key part
    of the company.\n\nThoughts on Non- Reliance Bidders:  I have spent a lot more
    time thinking \nabout this issue.   I can talk you through the reasons, but as
    long as \nReliance is involved and a western company can only purchase a 30% \nnon-operated
    working interest, we will have to take a huge discount to fair \nvalue.  I will
    be very surprised if we could get $450 million.  Again, going \nto the Shell's,
    BG's,,,etc  early on in the process,  I believe, is a huge \nmistake, both internally
    and externally.\n\nInformation Flow and Process:  Ken this is a very sensitive
    area but I feel \ncompelled to mention this to you.  I am concerned about too
    many people \nknowing our plan and strategy and possibly others wanting to branch
    out with \nthe intentions of helping, but actually causing problems.  This needs
    to be \nmanaged by one person, not three or four.  To meet all of our objectives
    this \nhas to be an orchestrated deal from a to z.  I think you know more about
    my \nbackground then most others in Enron.  I worked the E&P M&A business for
    10 \nyears and did pretty well at it.  I know the oil business and I believe that
    \nis a key to getting a good deal done.  I know these assets and all of the \ncomplex
    issues surrounding the assets, our subsidiaries, tax issues and the \nbook considerations.
    \ I'm the best person to get this deal done once you \ndecide the risk the company
    is willing to take.  I know the limits of my \nauthority and I will work within
    those bounds and keep the OOC completely and \ntotally informed so proper decisions
    can be made when necessary. \n\nKen, I promise you I will use others in the company
    where and when \nappropriate.  If I need help in India, I would not hesitate to
    ask Sanjay for \nsuch.  However, the last thing we can afford is excess discussion
    in India on \nthis deal.  If Dhirubhai agrees to the deal, we need to get a meeting
    set in \nEurope at a neutral site to start the process.  My main objective is
    to  have \na successful deal.  \n\nI have decided not to go to India so we can
    concentrate on moving this \nforward.  Also, I will need your guidance on the
    future of the E&P plans for \nEnron when we decide the direction we plan to take
    on Panna, Mukta and \nTapti.  I have looked at the key people necessary to make
    this happen and can \ntalk to you about that as well if you so desire.\n\nThanks\njeff"

  subject: New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language
  text: "Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the \nattached
    new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for \ncompanies
    with a high level of financial stability as determined by \nindependent market
    analysts (i.e. \"A\" rating for Holding Companies or \ninvestment grade rating
    for utility companies).  This is not a permanent \nexemption as PUHCA would again
    apply should the company loose its high rating.\n\nMidAmerican's lobbyist reported
    this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's \nreported commitment that we would
    review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, \nKen Lay was non-committal but not
    negatively disposed.\n\nThe utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE)
    offer this as an \namendment to a \"must pass\" piece of legislation during the
    waning days of \nthis Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities'
    \nstrategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes
    \ntax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as
    \ncontributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to \npaid
    into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth \nEdison)
    and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. \n2944).\n\nSenator
    Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA \namendment
    and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed \nto the idea.
    \ I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've \nreviewed it and
    convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the \nconcept to insure
    stockholder protection along with consumer protection was \nSenator Kerrey's idea.
    \ \n\nIt is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA)
    \nwould still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact
    \nthat Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the
    \nDemocrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not
    \nhe is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive \nelectricity
    restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is \"at least \nthree years away
    from happening.\"\n\nSteve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week
    as to our position \non this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date
    has been to \noppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities
    like \nSouthern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the
    \nMidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access \nprovisions
    in turn for our PUHCA exemption support. \n\n"

    in North America. Under Lay's leadership, the company has grown to $31
    billion in annual revenues. For the past four years, Fortune magazine has
    named Enron the most innovative company in America.

    Lay, a Missouri native, earned bachelor's and master's degrees from MU in
    1964 and 1965, respectively, garnering Phi Beta Kappa distinction as an
    undergraduate. He completed a PhD degree in economics from the University of
    Houston in 1970.

    After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, Lay joined Pinkney Walker as
    his technical assistant in Washington, D.C., in the early 1970s. At that
    time, Walker had just been appointed a commissioner of the Federal Power
    Commission. Lay later served as deputy undersecretary of the U.S. Department
    of Interior.

    Lay is a member of the President's Council on Sustainable Development, the
    Business Council, the National Petroleum Council and the American Enterprise
    Institute. He is a member of the board of trustees of the H. John Heinz III
    Center for Science, Economics, and the Environment. He is also a director
    for Compaq Computer Corp., Eli Lilly and Co., and Trust Company of the West.

    Lay received the college's Alumni Citation of Merit in 1990 and an honorary
    Doctor of Law degree from MU in 1992. He received the Private Sector
    Council's 1997 Leadership Award, was inducted into the Texas Business Hall
    of Fame in 1997, and was presented a Horatio Alger Award in 1998.

    Dr. Lay:

    We need a bio of you to include in the program for the Herbert J. Davenport
    program on October 13. I have attached the bio of you that we used in the
    brochure announcing the Pinkney C. Walker Endowment. Perhaps, with a few
    adjustments, it will be suitable for this current need.

    Please review the bio and send me any changes you would like made as soon
    as
    possible.

    Thank you very much for your prompt attention to this.

    Sincerely,

     Dear Ken,

     As you know our first meeting will be on Tuesday, May 23 at 4:30
    p.m.  Pete Peterson, chairman of the Blackstone Group, has kindly agreed to
    host it in his conference room. The address is:

     The Blackstone Group

     I know that some plans have changed since we first set the meeting,
    with some people being away and others having cancelled trips, so could you
    please reconfirm whether or not you will be able to attend?

     Sometime next week, we will be sending you an agenda and a
    background paper that focuses on the issues we propose to discuss. I greatly
    appreciate all the help members of the panel have given Tim Koller and me.
    As you know, Tim Koller is the McKinsey&Co. partner who kindly prepared the
    draft outline we originally sent around.  He will also be preparing the
    paper you will receive shortly.

     I am attaching the final list of panel members. Please do look it
    over. There are some significant additions: Kenneth Lay of Enron, Rob Glaser
    of RealNetworks, Len Baker of Sutter Hill Ventures,  Dennis Powell of Cisco.


     I look forward to your rsvp, and hopefully to seeing you on May 23.

    for every young person \nto obtain the very best possible education they can.
    \ As to our family, \nwithin the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth
    was married to a \nyoung man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they
    were both \nworking on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently

    Intuit Names Stephen Bennett As President, CEO\n> Senior Financial Services Executive
    Brings Broad Experience Growing\n> Diverse Businesses\n> Mountain View, Calif.
    -- Jan. 24, 2000 -- Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU\n> <http://www.quicken.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=INTU>)
    announced today\n> that its board of directors has selected Stephen M. Bennett
    as president\n> and chief executive officer. Bennett assumes his responsibilities\n>
    immediately, succeeding Bill Campbell, who had been acting chief executive\n>
    since September. Campbell is retiring from day-to-day responsibilities but\n>
    will remain chairman of the board of directors. Bennett was also named to\n> the
    board.\n> Bennett, 45, was most recently an executive vice president and member
    of\n> the Office of the CEO at GE Capital, the financial services subsidiary of\n>
    General Electric Corp. GE Capital is the world leader in numerous\n> financial
    industries, including private label credit cards, commercial\n> equipment leasing
    and vendor finance. With $330 billion in assets, GE\n> Capital provides 42% of
    General Electric's overall profits and is among\n> the world's largest non-banking
    financial institutions.\n> \"Steve is an outstanding leader from a company renowned
    for strong\n> leadership,\" said Campbell. \"His experience is tailor-made to
    fit Intuit's\n> needs now and in the future. We wanted someone with service industry\n>
    knowledge, who had led large, complex organizations and with proven\n> ability
    to produce fast growth. Steve is the ideal choice to take Intuit\n> to the multi-billion
    dollar level.\"\n> \"Intuit is the leader in e-finance. Quicken.com is already
    the leader in\n> online tax preparation and online mortgage origination,\" said
    Bennett, who\n> will relocate from Connecticut to the Bay Area. \"I'm excited
    to have the\n> opportunity to continue developing services for the Internet and
    take\n> Intuit's industry leadership to new heights.\"\n> During his GE career,
    Bennett held significant leadership positions in six\n> different businesses within
    the company, spanning both manufacturing and\n> financial services. In his most
    recent position, he oversaw a portfolio of\n> five different companies whose more
    than 20,000 employees last year\n> generated $15 billion in annual volume. Prior
    to that, as president and\n> CEO of GE Capital e-Business, he pioneered the company's
    efforts to\n> leverage the Internet across GE Capital's worldwide portfolio of\n>
    businesses.\n> Previously he delivered significant growth as the president and
    CEO of GE\n> Capital's more than 4,000-employee Vendor Financial Services business.\n>
    Under his leadership, assets grew to more than $13 billion from $5 billion\n>
    and net income increased to $200 million from $80 million in four years.\n> Intuit
    board member John Doerr said he was impressed by Bennett's broad\n> base of experience.
    \"Steve knows business-to-business as well as\n> business-to-consumer. He knows
    service businesses. And he gets the Net.\n> Intuit's product leadership and Steve's
    ability to grow businesses are an\n> ideal match for our future.\"\n> Bennett
    added, \"Intuit's management team is strong, stable and experienced\n> and works
    well together,\" he said. \"This is one of the few management\n> teams to successfully
    and rapidly transform a company to the Net. I'm glad\n> to have the opportunity
    to lead Intuit's continued growth and expansion.\"\n> Scott Cook, Intuit founder
    and chairman of its executive committee, said,\n> \"Steve shares Intuit's values.
    He's a straightforward, no-nonsense,\n> results-driven executive who cares deeply
    about people. His\n> values-oriented leadership style energizes organizations

    I received your \ninteroffice mail concerning the below email.  I certainly understand
    that you \nwill not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule
    is \nquite demanding.  I believe that this group will benefit substantially by
    \nknowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it.  Is it \npossible
    to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as \nsuch?  If the
    alumni see that you support our efforts, they will take an \nincreased interest
    in participating and provide us a solid foundation with \nwhich to work.  Please
    provide me any feedback you may have.\n\nAs we talked about today, we would like
    to begin having occasional \"brown \nbags\" in an effort to get the alumni better
    acquainted with the university.  \nI believe that we should have one with Dr.
    Smith to promote the image \ncampaign, changes at the university, the tier 1 status,
    etc.  If you could \nmake it that would be great but if not that is OK as well.

    and am grateful for your \napproachability.  Please let me stress that I do not
    expect you to make all \nor even most of our events.  I would just like to let
    you know what we are \ndoing and if you find that you are free, we would love
    to have you.\n\nThank you for your time,\nJeff\n---------------------- Forwarded

    Cougars @ Enron\n\nMr. Lay,\nMy name is Jeff McClellan and I am President of the
    \"Cougars @ Enron\".  We \nare a group of Enron employees that are UH alumni that
    have banded together \nto form a chartered extension of the Houston Alumni Organization.
    \ We had our \nkickoff event in the 50th floor dining room on March 7th of this
    year and \nhave received substantial interest in our organization.  I wanted to
    drop you \na line to tell you not only about us, but also what we are doing.  As
    of \ntoday, we have 107 employees that have expressed interest in contributing
    to \nour group's success. We have several stated objectives:\n\n1. Network Enron
    Cougars together to build strong working relationships.  \nThis will benefit the
    employees as well as the company.\n2. Raise and present scholarships to Enron
    dependents to attend the \nUniversity of Houston.  This will help to ease education
    costs.\n3. Assist the company in its recruiting efforts concerning the university.\n4.
    Assist the university through financial gifts whenever possible.\n\nCurrently,
    here is what we have planned:\n\n4/15/2000 The HAO has given us their hall at
    \"Frontier Fiesta\".   Frontier \nFiesta is a festival thrown by the students
    and alumni that provides good \nfamily   fun. The HAO is having it catered and
    everyone is invited.\n\n9/16/2000 We are throwing a tailgate party to celebrate
    Dana Dimel's first \nhome football game against Army.  We are working with Chet
    Gladchuk to set up \na   tent, have it catered, listen to a live band, football
    tickets, etc.  We \nwould like to make this event open to all of Enron if possible.
    \ The \nuniversity will   provide Enron special recognition on both the Cougar
    Vision \nScoreboard and over the PA in both the first and second half of the contest.\n\nThese
    are the confirmed events so far as we are still in the opening stages.  \nWe anticipate
    to have more events planned (golf tournament) which I would \nlike the opportunity
    to share with you.  This group is designed to cater to \nits members, the company,
    and the university and I believe it is going to be \none of the most successful
    out there.  To achieve such a plateau, however, we \nneed to be a continuous draw
    to old and new alumni alike.  To have you as an \nalumni is truly a monumental
    draw to our employees and the university.  Would \nyou consider making several
    appearances with us at our events?  Your \nparticipation would greatly increase
    our exposure and ability to accomplish \nour goals and we would love the chance
    to honor you as one of our most \ndistinguished alumni.  If there are any suggestions
    that you may have as to \nhow to further our group, I would love to hear them.
    \ I understand that you \nare extremely busy and I do not wish to monopolize your
    time but this alumni \ncharter is something that I truly believe in and I hope
    you will agree that \nit has great potential.  With you support, we can attain
    a level of success \nthat will set us aside from any other group.\n\nThank you
    for your time,\nJeff\n\n\n\n\n"

    the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the \ncamping
    gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the \nfairgrounds in
    LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, \nthe National Multiple
    Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff \nSkilling, needs is your help
    in raising money for MS.\n\nEnron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships
    in these parts - over \n350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston
    to Austin under the \nEnron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise
    $350,000.  I am \nchallenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge
    a certain \namount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give
    you a \nbreak on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's
    \ncloser to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat \npledge
    is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge \nto this
    very worthy cause 1-1.\n\nI hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain
    its status as the top \nmoney raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank
    you for your \nconsideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate
    to call me.\n\nSherri x3-5984\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    \ Ralph believes that he will try to facilitate \na meeting between you and Chevron.\n\nWe
    have been working Ghana pretty hard, including the West African Gas \nPipeline,
    the Effasu Power Project, a marketing company and a host of other \npossibilities.
    \ We have told the Ghanaians that with what is going on right \nnow in Nigeria,
    the loss of projects in Cote d'Ivoire due to the coup d'etat, \nand the lack of
    speed in moving forward in Ghana , that we are slowing down a \nbit to determine
    if we can resolve current projects before taking on \nadditional ones.  \n\nClearly
    this is a bit of a \"cop out\".  I am reluctant to tell Ghana that we \nare slowing
    down generally in Africa because I don't want to hurt the barge \ndeal or jepordize
    the possible resolution of the large snowball in Mozambique \nand there is truth
    to the Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria issues.  And, of course, \nI don't want to alienate

    Mr. Lay reported to Bill \nReddick that when his phone (#2 R/H seat) rings and
    he answers that it \ndisconnects on him.  He told Bill that this is the third
    time he has reported \nthis problem.  I spoke personally with Bill about this.
    \ We checked and there \nis no record of this problem reported recently (we checked
    back to May 2000) \non all three Falcon 900's.\n\nLyndel checked the system and
    there does seem to be a problem with it \ndisconnecting if you pick it up before
    the third ring.  After the third ring \nit works fine.  That is all I know at
    this time.  Garrett Av is coming over \ntoday to check the system.\n\nI know you
    don't like emails but I didn't want this it slip by.  I've \ndiscussed this with

    going well at Enron.  I know you and/or your people have been\ndiscussing with
    Glenn Yago our so-called Emerging Domestic Markets Project.\nIt is an exciting
    one and we look forward to Enron's support, involvement,\nparticipation and leadership.
    \ Glenn will be in touch as the project\nunfolds.\n\nNow I am contacting you about
    our upcoming Global Conference, March 8-10,\n2000 in Los Angeles.  There are two
    issues.\n\nFirst, I am sure you are aware, we are holding our third annual Milken\nInstitute
    Global Conference March 8-10, 2000 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in\nLos Angeles.
    A copy of the program is attached. This year's event will have\na heavy contingent
    of institutional investors, corporate leaders, and\ntechnology, media and policy
    people in the audience.  On the program, we\nhave nine Nobel Laureates, several
    CEOs of major corporations, and other\nheavy hitters.  As you can see, there is
    a major technology slant to this\nyear's program.  It will be a great event.  We
    would love to have some\nrepresentation from Enron in the audience.\n\nSecond,
    we are still accepting corporate sponsorship for the event.  I have\nattached
    a copy of our Sponsorship Opportunities brochure that describes the\nvarious levels

  text: "Hi Liz -\n\nThe reason Ken and Linda were trying to reach you from the plane
    was that \nthey had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know
    their \npreference.  They would like to give the Jasmine Suite that they are \ncurrently
    in to the Vittors with a connecting bedroom, to take care of their \nfamily.\n\nThey
    would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the \nVittors
    have.\n\nKen and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully
    on \nthe 3rd or 4th floor.  They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view
    \non the North side.  If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the
    \npool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as \nquiet.
    \ The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths.\n\nThey said
    they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow.  The Hotel Meierhof's \nphone number
    is:  41-81-416-82-85, Fax is:  41-81-416-39-82.  They should \narrive in Davos

    \ \nSubject: e-Katz: Chief Kroeker\n\n\nOver the past week I have heard from many
    thoughtful and concerned citizens\nabout their opinions on Chief Kroeker.  About
    an hour ago, I held a news\nconference to release the statement below in response.
    \ I wanted to make\nsure you were able to read it in its entirety.\n\nYou are
    a part of my e-Katz list because of your work with me or my\nadministration.  To
    be removed from the \"e-Katz\" distribution list, simply\nreply to this e-mail
    with your request.  If you have multiple e-mail\naddresses you use, please include

    to remove.  For more information on\nthe Katz administration, visit our website
    at\nhttp://www.ci.portland.or.us/mayor.\n\n\nStatement Regarding Police Chief
    Mark Kroeker\n\n\"I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously.
    \ I have\nreviewed this situation with care.  I want to thank those who provided
    me\nfeedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.\n\n\"The
    performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests\nwith me.
    \ I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the\ntaped comments
    made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no\nway reflect my own
    personal beliefs.\n\n\"My community and staff discussions, along with reading
    all the e-mails and\ntranscripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill
    my thinking on this\nissue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his
    personal religious\nviews from his professional conduct?\n\n\"I have determined
    that he manages his duties without bias and will continue\nto do so. His performance
    has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau\nin a fair, respectful and
    inclusive manner.  He is moving our law\nenforcement efforts to a higher level
    of community policing.  Therefore, I\nhave asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief
    of Police.  He has my strong\nsupport to continue.\n\n\"The law provides that
    all city employees have a right to their personal\nreligious views.  I have a
    responsibility to review their employment status\nif their actions, as a result
    of their personal views, impair their ability\nto perform their professional responsibilities.\n\n\"Many
    of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he\nis \"out
    of step with Portland\" could be used in other Oregon communities to\nfire more
    liberal public officials who are \"out of step\" with their\ncommunity's conservative
    majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both\nways.\n\n\"Chief Kroeker
    will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He\nassures me he is prepared
    to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo\nthe damage, help me promote tolerance
    and acceptance of all people, than\njust walk away.\n\n\"He commits to a strong
    and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who\nare gay, lesbian, bisexual
    or transgendered, including those on his staff.\nHe has already begun outreach
    efforts and will continue to do so.\n\n\"He said he will redouble his efforts
    to promote respect and acceptance of\nall Portlanders and be steadfast and fair
    in his enforcement of the law.\n\n\"He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project
    to serve as a spokesperson\nto educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not
    a \"gay disease.\"\n\n\"He will continue to seek advice from the City Council,
    the Bureau's Sexual\nMinority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.\n\n\"He
    agrees to take all this on with all his heart.\n\n\"In the process I hope he and
    we all learn from this experience.  I will\nwork to turn this negative situation
    into a positive one: to expand our\nsense of tolerance; to promote the notion
    that regardless of a person's\npersonal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective
    public servant; and\nto deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.\n\n\"As Mayor,
    I will do my part and more.  I hope you will join me.\"\n\n\n\n"

    Economic Forum-Mr. Nishimuro's Notes\n\"What should be the environmental agenda
    for business in the 21st\ncentury?\"\n\n.Introduction\n1. Awareness of Environmental
    Issue\n1)   Environmental issue, like Global warming, Excessive use of\nnatural
    resources, Recycling, Pollution, is of major significance.\nThe impact on the
    business is becoming to increase.\n2)   The Kyoto Conference(COP3) defined an
    international framework\nfor dealing with the issue of global warming.\n(The GHG
    reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol are 6%\nfor Japan, 7% for the
    U.S.A., 8% for the EU)\nSpecific content for the Flexibility Mechanism/Kyoto Mechanism\n(for
    International Emissions Trading (IET), Joint Implement (JI),\nand Clean Development
    Mechanism(CDM)) will be decided on at COP6,\nwhich is scheduled for November 2000.\n
    \    GHG is a serious matter requiring a globally studying.\n\n2. GHG Reduction\n1)
    \  The relationship between GHG levels and climatic change\nremains uncertain
    at present and further research is required.\nPolicies will have to be devised
    that take account of developments\nin scientific knowledge and opinion and that
    also maintains\nflexibility.\n2)   Policy on GHG reduction must reflect the circumstances
    of\neach country and be based on a combination of regulatory measures,\neconomic
    measures and voluntary measures.\n     Excessive regulating may cause the unfairness
    in business\ncompetition.\n\n3. Energy Conservation\n1)   The U.S.A. is the largest
    consumer of energy. In such a\nlarge, mobile country, much\nconsumption is accounted
    for by the transportation sector.\n2)   The EU has pushed many advances in environmental
    protection,\nand has seen considerable progress in the use of renewable energy.\n\n3)
    \  Japan has very limited natural resources, and energy\nconservation has been
    promoted since the oil shocks of the 1970s.\nAs a result, Japan is a leader in
    making effective use of energy,\nand has the lowest level of GHG emissions against
    GDP.\nJapan's policy is to combine regulation with voluntary measures.\nIndustry
    has supported this by promoting voluntary environmental\nplans and other measures.\nJapanese
    industries including Toshiba are to improve the energy\nconsumption efficiency
    of their products and use of energy at\ntheir factories.\n\n4. Programme of Industry\n1)
    \  Energy conservation is to make up the cost reduction of\nproducts and recycling
    will bring about the effect on manufacturing\ncost saving in the long run.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n(See

    to normal after the MC!!!  I can only say that it\nwas a tremendous success, and
    everyone should be congratulated that worked\non the planning!\nNow to the final
    items.  We are billing everyone for the hotel, golf and\nregatta this week and
    we have a few questions.  The hotel and golf are easy.\nHowever the regatta is
    a different situation.  When we started this project,\nthe cost of the regatta
    was much less than when we finished.  We quoted\n$85.00 per person, however the
    Millennium rate was actually $100.00 per\nperson.  This would not be such a great
    problem, however we had 33 no-shows\nfor the regatta.  This being said, we have
    two choices.  We bill those that\nsailed for an additional $15.00 to make their
    charge $100.00 which then\nleaves us with a negative $3500.00.  Or, we also bill
    the 33 no-shows for\n$100.00 each which puts us pretty close to break even.\nIn
    the big picture, there have been some budget cost that were less than\nexpected
    and some that were more.  We will have the final budget complete by\nthe end of
    next week.\nThe most important issue, is it acceptable to bill those that sailed
    $100.00\nor do you want us to stay at the original price of $85.00?......Then,
    of\ncourse, what should we do about the no shows?  Possibly bill them a\ncancellation
    fee or the full fee?  Or, forget and forgive this time?\nI am leaving for Paradise
    tomorrow, however my trusted partner Janelle will\nbe here until the 20th of January.
    \ We would like to get everything\nfinalized before she leaves.\nGive us your
    thoughts.\n\nThe EX-MC Director\nSharon\n\n"

    \ \nSubject: Re: Lawsuit\n\n\nGentlemen;\n\nYou may or may not be aware, but each
    of you has been named as a defendant\nin a lawsuit.  The lawsuit has been filed
    by a Plaintiff who is represented\nby one of the law firms which has filed suit
    against i2 in the class action\nlawsuit (i.e. the Nike situation).  The Plaintiff
    in this lawsuit is a\nnominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff
    law firm.\n\nWhat makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it
    is a\nshareholder derivative lawsuit.  What this means is that the plaintiff\nshareholder
    has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages on\nbehalf of i2.
    \ The claim is based on the Nike facts, but the Plaintiff is\nclaiming i2 has
    been damaged by your actions.   What is interesting is that\nall damages recovered
    would go to i2.  So why the lawsuit?  The Plaintiff\ncan recover for all legal
    fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit.\nDerivative actions commonly follow class
    action filings, as a sort of\n\"tag-along\" type of action.\n\nThe Plaintiff attorney
    has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit\non your behalf.  Normally,
    I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firm\ntry and track you down, but they
    may try and serve you at an inappropriate\ntime, i.e. client meeting, during a
    speech.  Please let me know if you\nwould like for us to accept service on your
    behalf.  This is very common\npractice.\n\nI will send each of you a copy of the
    lawsuit.  Needless to say, you are\nindemnified for this, i2 will pay for all
    legal fees incurred to defend you\nand i2 does have insurance to cover this matter.\n\nPlease
    let me know of your decision to have i2 accept service on your\nbehalf.\n\nThanks\n\n\nBob

    my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the \nHyatt
    Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for \nan update
    on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within \nEGM.  This
    includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we \nexpect about
    500 people.  \n\nWe have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability
    of \nthese businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have
    \ncome in a few months.  \n\nI believe they will be motivated to see the growth
    and profitability.  We had \na record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That
    was 50% of what they \nmade in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December
    of 2000 alone \nwe made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a
    big impact.\n\nIf you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would
    go a long way \nin helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses
    are now \ncore to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.\n\nThanks
    for considering this and let me know if you need any other information \nor assistance.\n\nMike

  text: "All responses to this e-mail should be sent to kenneth.lay@enron.com\n\nDear
    Colette:\n\n In response to your e-mail concerning the upcoming New Delhi World
    Forum, I \nwould expect that this forum should evaluate the impact of what is
    happening \non our project at Dabohl with reference to enticing other foreign
    \ninvestment.  As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow \npaying
    and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for \nsometime and
    more recently both the State of Maharastra  and the Government \nof India have
    refused to honor their government guarantees on this project.  \nWe have filed
    a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be \nmoving into arbitration
    on that and a number of other issues in London in the \nnot too distant future.
    \ Again, I believe this will send a very negative \nsignal to the market place
    as to the advisability of international companies \ninvesting in India.  I would
    think you might want to build one panel around \nthis subject.  \n\n If there's

    the attention of:\nDr Kenneth L. Lay\nChairman\nEnron\n\n\nDear Dr Lay,\n\nWhen
    the Minister of Finance of India Yashwant Sinha recently presented the\n2001-2002
    national budget, it was widely acknowledged as a very ambitious\n\"dream budget\"
    which puts India on a high growth trajectory. Most key\nsectors should benefit
    from these reforms, which will thus give a new boost\nto the country's economic
    and social progress. As such, the budget was\nwelcomed with great enthusiasm by
    the Indian and international business\ncommunity.\n\nOn the occasion of our India
    Economic Summit 2001 to be held in partnership\nwith the Confederation of Indian
    Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in New\nDelhi, it will be the perfect time
    to assess the progress of the bold and\nextensive measures proposed in the recent
    budget, how they have been\nimplemented and how they have impacted the business
    environment, domestic\nindustry activity and foreign investment.\n\nAs we will
    soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, I\nwould like to take
    the opportunity to benefit from your expertise and\nunderstanding of the country.
    I would greatly appreciate receiving from you\nany particular topics or issues
    that you wish to see given priority on the\nagenda. Any suggestions of relevant
    speakers or experts that you may have\nwould also be welcomed.\n\nI look forward
    to receiving your response at the above e-mail address and\nkindly ask you to
    copy my colleague Mitra Khoubrou (e-mail:\nmitra.khoubrou@weforum.org).\n\nFor
    more information on the 2001-2002 Union Budget, please visit the\nwebsite of the
    Ministry of Finance of India at http://finmin.nic.in/fub.htm\n\nI look forward
    to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us in\nIndia again next December.\n\nBest
    regards,\n\nColette Mathur,\nDirector,\nCenter for Regional Strategies\nWorld

    Andrew S Fastow/Enron@EnronXGate \nSubject: Gerald Smith\n\nOver the past few
    months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various \nopportunities where
    Enron and Smith Graham & Company may be able to work \ntogether.  Unfortunately,
    the process was slowed when our primary contact at \nSmith Graham, Gabriel Hayes,
    left the firm earlier this year.  We have since \nreestablished discussions and
    the Global Finance Group is preparing a \nproposal that a portion (about $30 million)
    of the Enron Cash Balance Plan \nportfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers
    portfolio.  One-third of this \nmoney ($10 million) would be invested in bonds,
    which could be placed with \nSmith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total
    Plan assets are about \n$235 million.)\n\nThe proposal will be submitted to the
    Plan Administrative Committee at its \nquarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal
    should be well received as the \nCommittiee has previously requested that  we
    optimize our existing allocation \nto minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has
    been advised that Enron is \nlooking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and
    that a decision should be \nreached sometime in May.  We have not communicated
    the specific details of \nour intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the
    May 3rd meeting.\n\nI am available for further discussion at your convenience.\n\nRegards,\nTim

    Increasingly, Enron=01,s integrated products and services require the appro=

    We also want to reach the elected and appointed officials who set policy an=

    Mr. Lay,

    Now with cigarettes and alcohol banned from advertising, companies such as=

    AOL, Compaq, Southern Company, and Infoseek are on the tracks. Each race=20

    the 3:00 p.m. panel on \nMonday or Tuesday?\n\nThanks.\n\nRosalee\n\n\n\n\n\"PERSHING

    \"'Kenneth.Lay@enron.com'\" <Kenneth.Lay@enron.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: RE: for Rosalee
    - re Mr. Lay's participation at IEA ministerial\n\n\nDear Rosalee,\n\n I would
    again like to thank Mr Lay for agreeing to take part in both\nour IEA ministerial
    session and in the OECD Forum 2001 - Sustainable\nDevelopment and the New Economy.
    \ As discussed, he is to chair the first of\ntwo energy panels at the FORUM; his
    is titled \"Fuelling Sustainable\nDevelopment\".  On his panel will be Mr Kurt
    Yeager of EPRI (speaking on\nhydrocarbon issues), Mr Luis Echavarri, the head
    of the OECD's Nuclear\nEnergy Agency (speaking on nuclear power), and Danish Minister
    of Energy and\nEnvironment, Svend Auken (speaking on renewables and energy efficiency).\nThe
    panel is scheduled to take place starting at 3pm at the Cit, des\nSciences et
    de l'Industrie, in La Villete, in northern Paris.\n\nAs I believe I noted in our
    previous e-mail communications, while the IEA is\nresponsible for organising our
    ministerial session and the substantive\nissues related to the energy panels on
    the FORUM, the OECD is doing the\nFORUM logistics.  They have therefore asked
    that I forward to all speakers\nthe following note (see below). It asks that Mr
    Lay provide a number of\nlogistical inputs, including a biography and photo, as
    well as information\non any remarks he might choose to make. I note that as the
    chair of the\nfirst energy panel, he may not wish to make a formal presentation
    -- but\ntime does permit this if he wishes, and the decision is at his discretion.\nI
    would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can\nkeep
    our files current.\n\nOn our own side, the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting
    last Friday,\nand finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements.
    \ While\nMr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background\ndocuments
    to Mr Lay this week, I wanted to give you a heads up and find out\nif you had
    any \"last-minute\" questions which I might help answer.\n\nIn addition, I note
    that your last e-mail indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris\nduring our session.
    \ Some of our ministerial representatives are also\nplanning to bring spouses
    (in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham, who is\ncoming with his wife) -- do
    you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in\nany events during this period
    with any of these others?  If you let us know,\nwe would be happy to make arrangements.\n\nAlso,
    please let us know if others will be travelling with Mr Lay, and if we\nmight
    facilitate their logistics.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nJonathan

    -- SEC Report on Valuation\n\n\n  Attached please find the final draft.  Tim Koller
    and I hope\nit reflects all the changes suggested on the last conference call.
    \ Of\ncourse, we will never be able to satisfy everyone to the last detail, but
    I\nthink we came as close as we will get.\n\n  There is still some proof reading
    and minor editing to do,\nand we are working on that even as we send this off.\n\n
    \ To the best of my knowledge there may now be two \"individual\nviews\"  to go
    into what is now Attachment D.  Len Baker may feel that the\nlanguage on Safe
    Harbor doesn't go far enough.  Baruch Lev feels that the\nSEC should not only
    issue a \"concept release\" to solicit broad public\ncomments on a \"supplementary
    framework for reporting intangibles,\" but it\nshould create a task force to do
    the work.  (Most of the group feels this\napproach is too close to asking the
    SEC to mandate change.)  Baruch also\nfeels that in relying so much on voluntary
    disclosure, we are exaggerating\nwhat companies will, in fact, disclose. My suggestion,
    Len and Baruch, is to\nwrite a paragraph or two for Attachment D, if you wish.
    \ Hopefully, both of\nyou will begin with a sentence supporting the report in
    general, but if you\nfeel strongly that the report doesn't reflect all your views,
    please do\nstate them for the record.\n\n  Before we schedule a final call for
    last minute details,\netc,  I'd like to request an e-mail, fax or phone call from
    each of you\nletting me know if you can sign-off on the report.  I'd appreciate
    this by\nMonday, April 16th.\n\n  Thanks a million.\n\n  Best regards,\n  Jeff\n\n

    early, polls open at\n7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put\nit

    an eye out while you are at the polls for\nelectoral fraud and report any suspicious
    activity\nincluding inappropriate campaigning to the poll\nwatchers at the polls.
    The Democrats and the\nRepublicans will have representatives at most of the\npolls,
    let them know if there is suspicious activity.\nFinally, if you have time, call
    your local offices and\noffer your time to make phone calls to encourage\npeople
    to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to\nbe available to help prevent of
    voter fraud.\n\nFinally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come\nin. There

    an opportunity?? \n?\nTo help you answer the question, the company is Juno Online?Services,
    \ \nInc.?(NASDAQ: JWEB), a leading US ISP.? Juno is very interested in  working
    \nwith (and in advanced-stage discussions with) companies in the energy  \nindustry
    and working with them on strategic telecommunications and marketing  \npartnerships.\n?\nInformation
    about Juno is available at \"About Juno\" on Juno's Web site \nhttp://www.juno.com.?
    I've also attached an  executive summary to update you \n(or the relevant person
    at Enron) as to the  current status of Juno's \nbusiness.\n?\nThanks very much
    for your assistance, and I hope that this message finds  you \nwell.\n?\nBest,\n?\nToby\n?\nExecutive
    Overview of?Juno --\n\nThe company finished 4Q00 w/ $56MM in cash.? Total net
    loss for 2001  was \nprojected to be $10-$25MM, as the company focuses on billable
    services,  \ncontinues to reduce expenses, and looks to develop advertising and
    other  \nancillary revenue streams.? The company is confident that it can meet
    \ \nor?beat the loss target and made explicit statements that on-hand cash  \nresources
    are \"more than adequate\" to get the business profitable.? The  \ncompany has
    not publicly given a time-line for profitability to maintain  \nflexibility.  \nThe
    company controls one of the largest dialup subscriber audiences (4MM  \nactive
    subscribers as of 4Q00, 850K of whom are billable) on the Internet  \ntoday and
    is the 4th largest US ISP (after AOL, ELNK, and MSN).  \n2000 revenue came in
    at $114MM, 65% of which was derived from subscription  \nfees and 35% from advertising.?
    2001 revenues are expected to come in  \nbetween $100MM-$120MM, with the revenue
    mix moving toward 80% subscription \nand  20% advertising due to increased focus
    on billable services and the \nsoft  Internet advertising markets.  \nJuno has
    announced broadband agreements for its Juno Express product  \ncovering all mainstream
    broadband transport platforms -- AT&T Broadband,  \nTime Warner Cable, and Comcast
    (cable); Covad (DSL); Hughes (satellite); and  \nMetricom (wireless).  \nThe company
    has announced wireless distribution agreements for it's Juno  \nMobile product
    with Palm and Sprint PCS.? Other agreements are likely to  be \nforthcoming.  \nThe
    company has powerful propietary technology assets that give it a  \ncompetitive
    advantage.? The company has launched (internally but not  \npublicly) a new business
    unit -- Juno Solutions -- to investigate the  \nopportunity to license these technology
    assets to third parties both  \ndomestically and internationally.?  \nThe Juno
    Virtual Supercomputer Project represents another example of  Juno's \nefforts
    to develop ancillary revenue streams.? This distributed  computing \ninitiative
    aims to leverage unused computer processing power from  Juno's MMs \nof subscribers,

    done a little work \nfor the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.
    \ However, this \nbusiness currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant
    to see \nany sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.\n\nGiven the nature of the project,
    the approach from the Duchess and the fact \nthat she can clearly afford to pay
    for it herself, we really do believe no is \nthe right answer.\n\nPlease let me
    know if you want any further information or if you want me to \ncorrespond direct
    with the Duchess.\n\nBest wishes.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    Ken Lay, Steve\nLetbetter, Dan Smith, Kelly Frels, Ed Galante, Jim Edmonds, Jim
    Kollaer\n\nThe purpose of this email is to provide additional detail to follow
    up on\nthe phone call each of you received on Friday, checking availability for\ndinner
    with Congressman DeLay and others on Friday, April 6th.\n\nBACKGROUND  During
    the last week of February, BCCA and Partnership leaders\nmet separately with Congressman
    DeLay, Congressman Joe Barton and with two\ntop staff members of Mr. DeLay, in
    order to update them on our extensive\nactivities aimed at federal Clean Air Act
    compliance.  Pursuant to those\nmeetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some
    follow-up meetings to be\nheld in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to
    travel to this area\non\nthat day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton
    (R-Texas, Chairman\nof the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee
    on Energy and\nCommerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman,
    House\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee
    has\noversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and\ninteraction
    with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.\n\nAPRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time
    spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's\ncongressional district to meet with Brazoria
    and Fort Bend County local\nofficials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up
    the itinerary with a ship\nchannel tour and presentations on SIP status, science
    and modeling issues.\nWe are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these
    matters.\n\nHe has asked to end the day with a \"small dinner with CEOs\" to have
    a frank\ndiscussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called\nyour
    office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he\nand the
    other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in\naddressing some
    of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we\nalso invite Governor
    Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.\nDeLay will call the Governor
    to encourage his attendance.  This will\nobviously be a critical opportunity to
    relay targeted information and\nadvise\non strategy with key members of Congress
    and the Governor.  Everyone in\nattendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated
    talking points in\nadvance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately
    before\nor\nafter the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.\n\nRSVPs
    TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim\nEdmonds
    and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan\nand Kelly
    Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan\nSmith are unavailable.
    \ We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.\nWe will likely recruit two
    or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies\nto\nattend the dinner.\n\nMy current
    thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and\nto arrange the
    dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at\na\nboard member's
    home nearby.\n\nI trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will
    be the\nPartnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me
    with\nany questions you may have.  Thank you.\n\nAnne Culver\nSr. VP, Government

    Senator Bingaman, Democrats, Introduce Centrist Energy Bill

    Senator Jeff Bingaman (NM), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and
    Natural Resources Committee and Chair of the Alliance to Save Energy,
    introduced comprehensive legislation to shape the nation's energy policy.
    ``If we want to tackle [our energy] problem[s] head-on, we need a
    comprehensive plan that commits to increasing domestic production and to
    using energy more efficiently throughout the economy.  I believe this
    legislation sets out that plan," Bingaman said.

    Secretary Abraham Looks for Energy in Wrong Places

    Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, addressing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
    noted:  =01&America faces a major energy supply crisis over the next two
    decades.=018  But Abraham, like President Bush, is looking mainly to increa=
    se
    our supply of oil, coal, and natural gas, rather than approach both the
    supply and demand sides of the issue.  Secretary Abraham mentioned energy
    efficiency only once in his entire speech, even though a reduction in deman=
    d
    is the quickest, cleanest, cheapest (and most reliable!) energy source at
    our disposal.

    Last week, House Democrats threw their hat into the ring as the Democratic
    Caucus Energy Task Force held a news conference decrying Bush Administratio=

    intentions to cut energy research significantly in their FY 2002 budget.
    The Alliance is quoted in their report, which emphasizes the role of
    research and development in providing long-term energy solutions.

    Senate Hearing Examines Energy-Environmental Relationship

    Alliance president David Nemtzow testified at a March 21 Senate Environment
    Committee Subcommittee hearing on the relationship of energy policies and
    environmental policies.  Nemtzow pointed out that energy efficiency is now
    our nation=01,s second largest energy source.  He also offered a series of
    recommendations for the Senators simultaneously to promote energy and
    environmental goals.

    IPCC: Energy Efficiency is Key in Mitigating Climate Change

    The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the third and
    final volume of its Third Assessment Report on climate change, which
    examines climate change mitigation strategies and places a heavy emphasis o=
    n
    using energy wisely. The report finds that energy efficiency for buildings,
    transportation, and industry could account for more than half of the
    potential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by 2020. Natural gas
    technologies, more efficient power plant technologies, and combined heat an=
    d
    power play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plant
    emissions. And "low-carbon energy systems," such as renewable energy, can
    also make an important contribution. Perhaps equally important is the
    finding that there is "no single path to a low emission future."

    Barriers to Energy Efficiency In Public, Private Organizations

    There is a gap between the opportunities for cost-effective energy-
    efficiency investment identified in energy models and the levels actually
    seen in practice, according to SPRU, a science and technology policy
    research group in England. The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in a
    series of barriers, such as lack of capital, lack of information or hidden

    State of the World Report

    From the thinning of the Arctic sea ice to the invasion of the
    mosquito-borne West Nile virus, the Worldwatch Institute's State of the
    World 2001 shows how the economic boom of the last decade has damaged
    natural systems.   The report takes a fresh look at the most difficult
    challenge the world faces: how to build an environmentally sustainable
    economy before we do permanent damage to the natural systems that support
    our global civilization.

    Dallas Cleans the Air with the IECC Energy Code

    The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) voted this month to
    adopt the 2000 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) for the Dallas
    region.  This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, more
    than are built in 42 states.  One of the main reasons for adopting the code
    is the area's commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of the
    Texas state plan for controlling smog.  Since the IECC contains a new
    standard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin=
    g
    energy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants that
    serve the air conditioning load.  The Alliance supported Public Citizen, th=

    Texas Building Energy Institute, the Sustainable Living Alliance, NCTCOG
    staff, and others in this effort, working with the Building Codes Assistanc=

    A vacant house at 55 Fahrenheit uses more energy for heating than an
    occupied one at 68 Fahrenheit, according to GPU Energy.  The activity in an
    occupied house radiates a certain amount of heat and some of the energy
    users in your home are still operating while you areaway. Designed
    specifically for teachers and students, the GPU website features

    Dinner with Tom DeLay and others on April 6th -- additional infor \nmation\n\n\nTo:
    Bruce LaBoon, Steve Miller, Charles Duncan, Ken Lay, Steve\nLetbetter, Dan Smith,
    Kelly Frels, Ed Galante, Jim Edmonds, Jim Kollaer\n\nThe purpose of this email
    is to provide additional detail to follow up on\nthe phone call each of you received
    on Friday, checking availability for\ndinner with Congressman DeLay and others
    on Friday, April 6th.\n\nBACKGROUND  During the last week of February, BCCA and
    Partnership leaders\nmet separately with Congressman DeLay, Congressman Joe Barton
    and with two\ntop staff members of Mr. DeLay, in order to update them on our extensive\nactivities
    aimed at federal Clean Air Act compliance.  Pursuant to those\nmeetings, Mr. DeLay's
    office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be\nheld in Houston on Friday,
    April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area on\nthat day along with, and as
    host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman\nof the Energy and Power Subcommittee
    of the House Committee on Energy and\nCommerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin
    (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy
    and Commerce Committee has\noversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested
    support from and\ninteraction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.\n\nAPRIL
    6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's\ncongressional
    district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local\nofficials, Mr. DeLay
    has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship\nchannel tour and presentations
    on SIP status, science and modeling issues.\nWe are working closely with Mr. DeLay's
    staff on all these matters.\n\nHe has asked to end the day with a \"small dinner
    with CEOs\" to have a frank\ndiscussion about our clean air issues.  This is the
    dinner my staff called\nyour office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested
    in what he\nand the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist
    in\naddressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we\nalso
    invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.\nDeLay will
    call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will\nobviously be a critical
    opportunity to relay targeted information and advise\non strategy with key members
    of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in\nattendance at the dinner will be provided
    coordinated talking points in\nadvance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged
    immediately before or\nafter the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep
    in advance.\n\nRSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed
    Galante, Jim\nEdmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles
    Duncan\nand Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and
    Dan\nSmith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.\nWe
    will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies to\nattend
    the dinner.\n\nMy current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St.
    Regis and\nto arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly
    at a\nboard member's home nearby.\n\nI trust this additional information is useful
    to you.  I will be the\nPartnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate
    to call me with\nany questions you may have.  Thank you.\n\nAnne Culver\nSr. VP,

    request\n\nKen\n\nThanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria
    for help \nwith her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and
    our \nview is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we
    \nshould say a polite \"no\".\n\nThe background is summarised on the attached
    briefing note from Mike O'Neill, \nManaging Director of Lurgi Invent.\n\nAlnwick
    Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really \nis difficult
    to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work \nfor the Duchess
    in providing water features for the garden.  However, this \nbusiness currently
    loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see \nany sponsorship out
    of Lurgi Invent.\n\nGiven the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess
    and the fact \nthat she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do
    believe no is \nthe right answer.\n\nPlease let me know if you want any further
    information or if you want me to \ncorrespond direct with the Duchess.\n\nBest

    on Income Inequality and Pricing AIDS Medications to a  \nHuman Scale\n\n\nDear
    Dr. Lay:\n\nNew this week on www.TheGlobalist.com:\n\nRUDI DORNBUSCH ON INCOME
    INEQUALITY\nPoverty is bad -- but income inequality is not. MIT Professor Rudi\nDornbusch
    makes the argument that the development community\nshould not confuse inequality
    with poverty -- even though at the\nbottom they might feel the same.\n\nComing
    Monday: A New Globalist Paper\nPRICING AIDS MEDICATIONS TO A HUMAN SCALE\nIn a
    scramble for good publicity, pharmaceutical companies have\nstarted a downward
    bidding war in pricing AIDS medications for\nAfrican markets. To add a much-needed
    measure of fairness to\nthe process, we propose a better alternative -- adjusting
    the price\nof treatment to per-capita GDP.\n\nBest regards from Washington,\n\nStephan
    Richter\nPublisher and Editor-in-Chief\nwww.TheGlobalist.com\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso

    THE MOROCCAN DEEP\nRabat - This week the MENA Petroleum Bulletin spoke with Andrew
    Windham,\nGroup General Counsel for Energy Africa. Amina Benkhadra, General Manager
    of\nONAREP (25%) added to the growing list of re-entrants to Morocco, signing
    a\npetroleum agreement with Energy Africa (63.75%) and Taurus Petroleum AB\n(11.25%).
    This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three\nexploration permits
    offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit\nOffshore area.\nEnergy Africa
    Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum\n(co-partner) will implement
    exploration work on the three permits of the\nTiznit Offshore area covering approximately
    6000sq.km. This is Energy\nAfrica's second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage
    offshore Morocco, the\nfirst being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa
    holds 20% equity\nbringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km.\nAndrew
    Windham, said, 'the country has all the characteristics offshore\nwhich make potentially,
    for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is\nvery much untried and untested,
    so it is a very exciting place to be at the\nmoment. We are in right at the start
    of some new plays.'\nFor further details please see the April issue of the MENA
    Petroleum\nBulletin.\n\n\nREPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY\nLondon - Repsol YPF
    SA said it discovered oil at a second well during\nexploration in Libya. The well
    in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli,\nproduced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d,
    the company said in a press release.\nRepsol is testing the site on behalf of
    a consortium including OMV,\nTotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching
    for oil in the area\nin May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval
    for exploration and\nproduction sharing arrangements with foreign companies. The
    companies\ncurrently produce more than 160,000bbl/d from the Murzuq Basin, said
    the\ncompany.\n\n\nAHMED ABDELKARIM CONFIRMED AS NEW HEAD OF NOC\nTripoli - Further
    to reports this week from Libya Ahmed Abdel-Karim Ahmed\nhas been formally appointed
    as Chairman of NOC, following reports that he\nhad been removed from the position.
    Representing Libya at the OPEC\nconference in Geneva it was confirmed that Al-Badri
    has been appointed as\nDeputy Prime Minister for Social Security. The news will
    comfort foreign\ninvestors who feared that further upheaval would hinder an already
    slow\nratification process, with approvals outstanding for three packages of\nblocks
    offered by NOC in late 2000.\n\n\n\n*******SPECIAL FEATURES FOR 2001******\n\nThe

    \nSubject: Invitation for IAEE Keynote\n\n\nHi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank
    you so much for your extra help on our\ninquiry to Ken.  We understand completely
    that the April 25 slot following\nhis return from vacation is not the most ideal
    arrangement.  I think it's\nalways easiest for someone like him if he knows that
    a speech given recently\ncan easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted
    to remind you of\nmy previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal
    last May to\nthe World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that,
    and we\nwould work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add
    new\ncontent.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I\nmentioned
    the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it\ncomes to the
    idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets\nand business
    enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and\ndon't hesitate to
    ever ask for a \"quid pro quo\" from us.\n\nMichelle Michot Foss, Ph.D.\nDirector,

    Ware reportedly offered safe house by BBC\n\nThe BBC has reportedly offered a
    safe house to Panorama reporter John Ware,\nthe journalist most closely associated
    with the expose on the Omagh bombing.\n\nAccording to the Times newspaper, the
    Corporation has also offered Ware\npersonal protection.\n\nThe bomb blast outside
    the BBC's west London centre is being blamed on the\nReal IRA, who may have acted
    in revenge over the Panorama reports.\n\nMeanwhile, speculation that the BBC might
    move flagship current affairs\nprogramme Panorama back to a weekday slot - but
    on BBC2 - refuses to go\naway.\n\nMediaGuardian quotes an 'insider' as saying:

    of headless\ncorpses -victims of the ethnic bloodshed in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan\nprovince

    that the April 25 slot following\nhis return from vacation is not the most ideal
    arrangement.  I think it's\nalways easiest for someone like him if he knows that
    a speech given recently\ncan easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted
    to remind you of\nmy previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal
    last May to\nthe World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that,
    and we\nwould work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add
    new\ncontent.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I\nmentioned
    the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it\ncomes to the
    idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets\nand business
    enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and\ndon't hesitate to

  subject: Information from Ken Lay at Enron
  text: "Jim:\nIt was a pleasure speaking with you on Wednesday.  Based on our conversatio=\nn,=20\nthis
    email includes the following:\n\nAn Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale
    generation on Tribal lan=\nds.\n\nOur views on the impediments to distributed
    generation and suggestions on h=\now=20\nto remove those impediments.\n\nA description
    of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR=01,s ability=\n to=20\nsign contracts
    with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two=20\npossible options for
    addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC=20\norder clarifying that
    DWR will recover its power purchase costs through=20\nrates, and 2) an amendment
    to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.  I=\n=20\nhave attached talking
    points regarding the California PUC order and propose=\nd=20\namendments to AB1X.
    \ We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable=\n=20\noption.\n\nOur
    assessment of the supply/demand picture in California.\n\nOur suggestions for
    a legislative package designed to solve both the near-=\n=20\nand long-term electricity
    crisis in California.  We will deliver to your=20\noffice today detailed legislative
    language.  In those materials we will als=\no=20\nidentify existing bills that
    we believe can easily accommodate our proposed=\n=20\nlanguage.\n\nI hope that
    the information is useful.  Please do not hesitate to contact m=\ne=20\nif you
    would like to discuss these materials further, or if there is anythi=\nng=20\nelse
    that I can do to assist you.\n\nRegards,\nKen Lay\n\n\n\nContact Information to
    Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes=\n=20\nin Installing Small-scale
    Generation on Tribal Lands\n\nDavid Parquet, Vice-President\nEnron North America\n101

    415.782.7851\n\n\n2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation\n\nExcessive and Unnecessary
    Utility Stand-by Charges\n\nSolution: The executive orders issued by the Governor
    on February 14th took=\n a=20\nstep in the right direction.  Utility stand-by
    charges have always been=20\ndesigned by the utilities to protect their monopoly
    position, extract=20\nmonopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no
    reason to limit t=\nhe=20\nelimination of these charges to generation facilities
    that are less than=20\n1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the
    time it takes for=\n=20\nCalifornia to close the significant gap between supply
    and demand and reduc=\ne=20\nthe risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose
    lifting the cap by=20\noffering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate
    development o=\nf=20\ndistributed generation.\n=20\nExcessive delays and costs
    related to interconnecting facilities with=20\ninvestor-owned and municipal utilities\n\nSolution:
    \  The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =\na=20\nstep
    in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20\ninterconnection
    studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=\n=20\nrequirement
    applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20\ngeneration.  In
    addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=\n=20\ninterconnecting
    generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=\n=20\nthrough executive
    orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20\npossible, California
    should shift control over interconnection away from th=\ne=20\nutility and place
    that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20\naccomplished through
    amendments to SB 27X.\n\nPermitting and Air Quality Issues\nDevelopers of distributed
    (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=\n or=20\ngreater must receive
    certification from the California Energy Commission an=\nd=20\ntherefore face
    all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20\ngeneration faces. =20\n\nSolution:
    California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=\n=20\nD-26-01)
    issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=\n=20\noutput
    apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=\nities.=20\nIn
    addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=\n=20\nface
    local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20\ninterests
    cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=\n. =20\nThese
    objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.\n\n3. Credit Concerns
    Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=\n=20\nElectricity on Behalf
    of the Utilities=20\n\nEnron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into
    power contracts with=\n=20\nsuppliers.\nEnron is in active discussions with DWR
    to establish contract terms with th=\ne=20\ngoal of entering into a power purchase
    agreement as soon as possible.\nHowever, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created
    significant credit risk=\n=20\nconcerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize
    contract terms.\nWe understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share
    Enron=01,s c=\nredit=20\nrisk concerns.\nEnron has proposed several options for
    resolving the credit risk issues and=\n=20\nis working with DWR to arrive at a
    solution that is mutually agreeable to=\n=20\nboth sides and that might serve
    as a template for power purchase agreements=\n=20\ngoing forward.\n\nSummary of
    the Source of the Credit Risk Issue\n\nAmbiguous Ratemaking Authority\nThe language
    in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20\ncharge California
    ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=\n=20\nanalysis of the
    bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20\nCalifornia PUC=01,s
    exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =\nAs=20\nsuch, suppliers
    have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=\nes=20\nadequate
    charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.\n\nAmbiguous Regulatory Authority
    Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018\nThe language in AB1X leaves open the possibility
    that the California Public=\n=20\nUtilities Commission could determine that power
    purchases made by DWR are=\n=20\n=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding,
    the CPUC could then ref=\nuse to=20\nallow DWR to collect from ratepayers the
    costs associated with its power=20\npurchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no
    assurance that the PUC will agr=\nee=20\nto include in rates the charges to cover
    the costs of power contracts that=\n=20\nDWR has entered into with suppliers.\n=20\nAmbiguous
    Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=\n=20\nRecover
    DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases\nIn addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking
    and regulatory authority=\n=20\nnoted above, the language in the bill is equally
    ambiguous with respect to=\n=20\nthe specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that
    AB1X directs the PUC to empl=\noy to=20\npermit DWR to recover its power purchase
    costs. Based on our analysis, it i=\ns=20\nextremely difficult to determine how
    the PUC would design the rates to ensu=\nre=20\nDWR recovers its power purchase
    costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =\nis=20\ndifficult to determine whether
    AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=\n=20\nrates all of the charges necessary
    to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=\n=20\ncosts.  Again, this ambiguity
    raises significant credit risk concerns since=\n=20\nsuppliers have little assurance
    that DWR will have the ability to recover=\n=20\nfrom ratepayers the costs of
    purchasing power.\n\nOptions to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20\n\nWe
    have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=\nsk=20\nissues.
    \ We have identified three options:\n\nAmend AB1X\nThe amendments, which are attached
    to this email, would clarify that a) the=\n=20\nPUC would accept as =01&prudent
    and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=\nred by=20\nDWR, and b) the PUC is
    obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =\nto=20\nensure that DWR
    fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=\n=20\npreferred option,
    though we understand that the there may be some political=\n=20\nchallenges standing
    in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20\nentitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)\n\nClarify
    the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20\nthrough Contract
    Language\nThis is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials
    to=20\nimplement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly
    mo=\nre=20\ntime to implement than the \"legislative\" fix.  We have attached
    electronic=\n=20\ncopies of the talking points related to the order that the California
    PUC=\n=20\nwould need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20\n=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)\n\nMake
    Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk\nAs indicated in our
    letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=\ncept=20\nother forms
    of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=\n=20\ncash prepayment,
    or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=\n=20\nindicated to us
    that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=\n=20\nprefers to
    clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=\n=20\ncontract
    amendments.\n\n4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001\n\nBoth
    the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20\nAssociates
    (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=\n=20\nshowing
    that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=\nr=20\nonly
    on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=\nl=20\ncredible
    sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=\n=20\nof 2001
    and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20\nlikely. =20\n\nCEC
    and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20\nsummer
    by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20\nestimates.
    \ California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=\n well=20\nbelow
    the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=\nn=20\nin
    the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=\n=20\nthan
    other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20\nunpredictability
    of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=\no=20\ndate. In the
    event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=\nhe=20\nflexibility
    to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20\nCalifornia=01,s very
    low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =\nthis=20\nrequirement.
    =20\n\nOther reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=\n=20\ndraw-down
    of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=\nre=20\nsupply-demand
    gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=\n=20\nnumber of
    customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20\nutilities.  Cambridge
    Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=\nt=20\npace of siting,
    permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=\n=20\nadded to correct
    the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.\n\nCERA predicts that California
    is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=\n=20\nrolling black outs this summer.
    \ The CEC paints a considerably more=20\noptimistic scenario, betting that California
    will bring an additional 5,000=\n=20\nMWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.
    \ It is our view that California=\n=20\nshould view the CEC's \"rosy scenario\"
    with considerable skepticism.\n\n5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals
    Designed to Solve California=\n=01,s=20\nElectricity Crisis\n\nThis email offers
    an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=\nl=20\ndeliver to your
    office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=\n=20\nbills that we
    believe can accommodate our proposals.\n\nAs we have suggested throughout the
    crisis, any solution to California's=20\ncrisis must focus on four issues:\n\nIncrease
    supply\nDecrease demand\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market\nReturn
    California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency\n\nIncrease supply--Legislative
    vehicle: SB28X (Sher)\nTo site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately
    2 years. =\n=20\nEnron and others have completed the entire process in other states
    in less=\n=20\nthan a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.\n\nThe
    Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=\nslation=20\nare
    steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=\nse=20\nefforts
    by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=\n=20\nin
    securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20\nrequirements
    included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=\n=20\nproposal
    seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20\ntransfering
    credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20\ninnovative emissions
    reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20\nemissions in advance of obtaining
    certification, and permits the affected a=\nir=20\ndistricts to use those funds
    to finance projects that will produce the=20\nrequired reductions in pollution
    emissions.\n\nDecrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)\nBecause
    of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=\n=20\nthe
    supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=\n=20\nbest
    chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=\nst=20\neffectively
    and quickly in two ways:\n\nBuy-down demand\nCalifornia is tapping into an enormous
    amount of money from the General Fun=\nd=20\nto finance DWR=01,s power purchases.
    \ California could likely reduce demand=\n more=20\neconomically by running an
    auction to determine the payments businesses wou=\nld=20\nbe willing to receive
    to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=\n=20\nthrough the summer
    months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20\ndetermine the price it
    could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20\nparticipate, businesses would be
    required to have the metering equipment=20\nnecessary to monitor and verify that
    they are actually achieving the=20\nreductions.  Enron has developed an on-line
    auction software package, =01&D=\neal=20\nBench,=018 that it would be willing
    to contribute to the effort.\n\nUse Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment\nTo
    be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:\n\nAn internet
    based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=\n=20\nfor hour-ahead
    power in real time.=20\nReal-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily
    curtailment=\n=20\nverification.\nSettlement process that allows for market clearing
    prices of energy to be=\n=20\npaid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).\n\nThe
    potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=\ne:\n\n=01&creation=018

    \nare holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will \ninclude
    the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their \ncompany's
    strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to \nask you guys
    to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would \nreally highlight
    Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a \"Core School\" in \nthe MBA recruiting
    process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for \nMarch 28th.  I appreciate
    your consideration.\n\nKevin\n\n----- Forwarded by Kevin Hannon/Enron Communications

    Subject: \n\nKevin-\n\n\nJust a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding
    Enron's\nparticipation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the\npossibility
    of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a\nchance to float these
    ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on\nyou plate.  Let me know if you
    have any sense of how this might go. \nBelow is the earlier email I sent to you.
    \ Thanks for the help.  Hope all\nis well with you.\n\n\n            Nov.2 email
    text\n\n\nWe at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link\nwith
    Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the\nagile organization
    which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable\nmarkets of the next decade.
    \ One connecting point which we would like\nEnron to consider is with our Center
    for Leadership in Dynamic\nOrganizations which draws faculty and students from
    across Cornell and\nbeyond.\n\n\nThe specific activities that we propose at this
    point in time are two. \nFirst, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron
    to be a key\nspeaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As\ndescribed
    in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three\nconferences focused
    on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and\nstudents.  We very much would
    like Enron to present what we call a \"live\ncase study\" at the corporate conference
    on <underline>March 28,\n2001</underline>.\n\n\nYou, of course, are an obvious
    candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this\nis the kind of event that is made
    to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay\nand would give them a chance to interact
    with other corporate leaders and\nthe Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders
    we have signed up for the\ncorporate conference are John Loose, President and
    COO of Corning, Ken\nChenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne,
    just announced\nPresident of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders
    has a\ndistinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in\ncontinually
    reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  \n\n\nWe have several
    other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership\nWeek, including Ken Blanchard
    and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman\nSachs.  We have some chance of getting
    Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company\nand an outside shot at Jack Welch through our
    President Emeritus Frank\nRhodes, but these are still long shots.\n\n\nThe point
    is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the\nJohnson School and
    probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted\na platform for telling
    the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If\nthey can't do it, hopefully we
    could convince you to do it.  Again, the\ndate is March 28, 2001.       \n\n\nThe
    second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same\nlines.
    \ In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it\ncould become the
    basis for the March conference live case study\npresentation.  We believe that
    Enron is unique in its ability to\nliterally create new markets.  The question
    is how do you lead and manage\nan organization to keep the tight financial and
    risk controls in place\nthat you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior
    that seems to\nbe the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems
    and\npractices make this possible.\n\n\nI know that Enron was the subject of two
    Harvard cases in 1993 and around\n1997.  As I understand it neither focused on
    organizational and\nleadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research
    team to\nbuilding this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee
    Dyer\nfrom the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the\nEnron
    organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast\nmoving organizations
    and are committed to doing this in a very efficient\nway.\n\n\nKevin, we appreciate
    your willingness to entertain these two ideas and\nhopefully test them with your
    top leaders.  We will do anything we can to\nmake it feasible for Enron to engage
    with us on these two initiatives. \nPlease let me know what I can do to help you
    carry this forward.  As\nalways, thanks for your great personal support.\n\n\nDick\n\n\n\n"

    have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports\nFacilities,
    L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million\nprepayment by
    the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by\nthe partners to the
    referendum campaign.\n\nAssuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports
    Authority, we expect\nto be able to start making contributions to the referendum
    campaign this\nweek.  The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign
    by the\npartnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from\neach
    such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed\nto the
    campaign instead of being distributed.  I have discussed this\nprocedure with
    Sue Walden.\n\nWith respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what
    you and\nShell had agreed to.  The monies being contributed to the referendum\ncampaign
    are being contributed to a special purpose political action\ncommittee (as required
    by law).  This special purpose PAC is subject to the\ngeneral Texas laws that
    govern campaign fundraising.  As you know, one of\nthese laws provides that \"a
    person may not knowingly make or authorize a\npolitical contribution in the name
    of or on behalf of another unless the\nperson discloses in writing to the recipient
    the name and address of the\nperson actually making the contribution . . . .\"
    \  Pending a better\nunderstanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's
    $100,000 in the\npartnership's account.\n\nPlease contact John Watson at 713-758-2556
    or me at 713-758-2350 if you have\nany questions regarding the foregoing.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael

    am sorry to say that earlier this week Arthur Levitt was called to\ntestify in

    planned. It is my hope that we can reschedule with him\nprior to -- or in conjunction
    with -- the final report. For those who may\nhave changed their schedules to make
    this meeting because of the chance to\ntalk to Arthur, I regret the inconvenience.\n\n
    In deference to your time, we'll go ahead with the meeting from 5 to\n7 but not
    with the dinner.\n\n Here are the details of the meeting.  Note that the location

    final report, prepared by Tim Koller.\nIt will be the subject of the meeting.
    \ We will want to gather your comments\non the following:\n\n     1.  Do you agree
    with the substance\nof this draft?\n     2.  Are there points that should\nreceive
    more or less emphasis?\n     3.  Are there any other issues you\nwould like to
    raise?\n     4.  Is there anything else about the\ndrafting and presentation that
    you would\nlike to comment on?\n\n We will need to get everyone's comments, one
    way or another, by the\nend of September so we can proceed to prepare the final
    paper, which we'd\nlike to have ready by the end of October.\n\n Originally you
    said that you would not be able to make the meeting.\nCould you let us know if
    your plans have changed and you can now come or\nparticipate by phone?  See below
    for reply.\n\n   ____ I will be there\n\n   ____  I will participate by phone\n\n

    awenner@velaw.com\ncc:  \nSubject: New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language\n\nYesterday,
    Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the \nattached new legislative
    amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for \ncompanies with a high level
    of financial stability as determined by \nindependent market analysts (i.e. \"A\"
    rating for Holding Companies or \ninvestment grade rating for utility companies).
    \ This is not a permanent \nexemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company
    loose its high rating.\n\nMidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to
    me along with Ken Lay's \nreported commitment that we would review it as soon
    as we could.  Reportedly, \nKen Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.\n\nThe
    utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an \namendment
    to a \"must pass\" piece of legislation during the waning days of \nthis Congressional
    session.  This will be separate from the utilities' \nstrategy to enact Private
    Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes \ntax language to exclude water
    and sewage connection fees from gross income as \ncontributions to capital and
    language to increase the amount permitted to \npaid into nuclear decommissioning
    reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth \nEdison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability
    legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. \n2944).\n\nSenator Kerrey has already spoken to
    Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA \namendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal
    but not negatively disposed \nto the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff
    next week after they've \nreviewed it and convey their views to you.  According
    to MidAmerican,  the \nconcept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer
    protection was \nSenator Kerrey's idea.  \n\nIt is possible that Congressman Dingell
    (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) \nwould still actively oppose this limited
    exemption, especially given the fact \nthat Congressman Dingell (who would Chair
    the Commerce Committee should the \nDemocrats regain control of the House) has
    recently said that whether or not \nhe is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress,
    that comprehensive \nelectricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal
    is \"at least \nthree years away from happening.\"\n\nSteve and Rick, can we get
    a temperature gauge next week as to our position \non this amendment?  As a reminder,
    Enron's position here-to-date has been to \noppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as
    this is the one provision utilities like \nSouthern Company really want.  To date,
    this strategy has worked with the \nMidAmerican Utility Group willing to support
    our transmission open access \nprovisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support.

    to a new political landscape on 2 July 2000. The economic and \nbusiness climate
    is positive and full of new opportunities as Mexico finally \ncompletes a long
    transition from one-party dominance to pluralist democracy, \nadding political
    maturity to a more competitive market economy.\n\nIn light of the above, the World
    Economic Forum will hold a Mexico Meeting \n2000 on 4-5 December in Mexico City.
    Held in collaboration with the Mexican \nInvestment Board, this gathering will
    take place three days after the \ninauguration of the new Mexican administration.
    We have already received \nconfirmation that President-elect Vicente Fox and Mexican
    Central Bank \nGovernor Guillermo Ortiz will participate. We are also expecting
    the presence \nof the future key cabinet members and state governors.\n\nAs usual,
    the World Economic Forum pulls together the right group of leaders \nto discuss
    issues, build a network of contacts and identify where future \nbusiness opportunities
    and risks lie. The Meeting will focus on four main \ntopics: the country's political
    and social agenda, Mexico's commercial \nrelationships with the rest of the world,
    the new economy and the key issues \nfor the country's main industries.\n\nPlease
    consult our website, http://www.weforum.org/mexico, where information \nwill be

    to complete the funding for the\nprofessorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted
    that you plan to\nattend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.\n\nThe purpose
    of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient\nway of reaching
    you, is two-fold:\n\n     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship
    the Pinkney\nC. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating
    the\nprofessorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some\nother
    area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in\nthe College
    of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.\nBoth Bob Pugh
    and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into\nHarold Hook to seek
    his input.\n\nA few points of elaboration:\n     * \"Distinguished\" is a standard
    adjective in the titles of such\npositions.\n     * We will use a committee of
    faculty and administrators within the\ncollege to select the recipient of the
    professorship, subject to my\napproval.\n     * And, I don't know if we will have
    the recipient selected by October\n13.\n\nThis name for the professorship (1)
    coincides with Pinkney's great strength,\n(2) allows me to avoid any \"turf battles\"
    (either within the college or with\nEconomics) and (3) underscores the great importance
    of teaching in the\ncollege.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to
    this name.\n\n     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport
    Society\nbanquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief\ntalk
    (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of\nbusiness.
    \ Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive\nevent.  By way
    of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now\nlive in Dallas and
    are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have\nchosen the future of business
    as the theme for the banquet and program.\nYour talk would come after dinner and
    could be preceded or followed\n(probably followed) by the announcement of the
    Pinkney Walker Professorship.\nI understand from Rosalee that you will be giving
    a talk in Austin the\nmorning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it
    would be suitable\nfor the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great
    latitude in\nchoosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know
    if you\nwill serve as the keynote speaker.\n\nIf you can give me quick responses
    to these 2 requests, we will complete the\nplans for the evening, which will include
    the annoucement of the Pinkney\nWalker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address
    by you.  Naturally, if\nyou have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.
    \ My office # is\n573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.\n\nLet me close
    by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not\nPinkney would
    attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been\nexperiencing some
    health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that\nhe intends to attend,
    due in large part to your commitment to be there.\nTime permitting, you might
    want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll\nsee him here in Columbia on
    October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his\nwife arrive on October 12, I will
    invite them to attend an informal dinner I\nwill host that evening for members
    of the college's advisory board.  Of\ncourse, you are invited to attend the dinner
    on October 12 as well, but it's\nmy understanding that you will fly to Columbia
    on October 13.)\n\nKen, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample
    dose of \"R&R\"\nduring your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.\n\n"

    interest on both sides.  Besides help on the\ndevelopment front, we think there
    may be value in our acting as a bit of a\nbuffer between the Sports Authority
    and the Rockets and coordinating any\nissues involving the new convention hotel(where
    we are also providing\ndevelopment management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker
    & Botts) have\ntalked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks
    this\nshould \"be the Authority's idea.\".  One issue is how much of our fee would\napply
    to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much\nwould apply
    to the Arena.  Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted you\nto know about
    this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.\nIf you have any thoughts
    in advance of the next breakfast meeting, please\ngive me a call at 713-966-2606.\n\nAlso,

    Subject: Invitation to deliver 2001 IAEE conference keynote


    Dear Ken:

    Next April 25-27, 2001, Houston will host the 24th conference of the
    International Association for Energy Economics, in combination with the
    annual meeting of our U.S. Association for Energy Economics affiliate.  We
    invite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon
    on Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this
    event.

    Our theme is "2001: An Energy Odyssey." We are using the conference to
    showcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to
    deal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as
    enterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to
    clearly define these major themes and priorities than you.

    I was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in
    Montreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that
    the regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t=
    o
    heart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the
    opportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of
    vital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include
    comments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both
    guiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in
    markets on behalf of enterprises.

    The IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an=
    d
    university interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo=
    u
    up-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure
    Rosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together
    for you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc=
    e
    (at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In
    addition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of
    RD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues
    and Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a
    joint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology
    Conference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.

    Finally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate
    sponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,
    which you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel=
    p
    identify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary
    session, "Sustaining Development" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn
    thinking around with our re-phrasing).

    I hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.  We
    look forward to having you with us next April!

    Dear Mr. Galvan,

    Thank you for your recent letter concerning my support of a new basketball=

    o day=20
    business- I take a leading role in the communities where my employees live=
    =20
    and work. =20

    I agree that corporate stewardship is essential in our community. At Enron,=
    =20
    we are aware of the underserved populations in our neighborhoods, which is=
    =20
    why each year we give back one percent of our earnings to charitable causes=

    As we have grown, so have these donations. Enron=01,s community investments=

    Three years ago, Houstonians took the initiative to keep the Houston Astros=

    efforts.=20

    Houston has a vibrant, attractive, central business district that is=20
    recognized globally.  A basketball arena is of key importance for the=20

    Enron has more than 6,500 employees who work and live in Houston and we all=
    =20
    take great pride in this city and its success.  We plan to stay in Houston=

    Beach Bowl\n\n\nHello, Mr. Lay! Enron and MDA are joining together again to do
    a 2nd Annual \nBeach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great
    success, \nraising over $70,000.  This year's goal is to raise $100,000, so the
    \nfundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will
    \nbe used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).\n\nI have put together
    a team of Analyst interns (Howard Goldfarb, Rachel \nMcPhaul, Nicole Brady, Bradley
    Aiken and myself) for a second year to help in \nthis cause.  The benchmark for
    the team is the raise $600 (pre-matching), but \nI want to outdo the fundraising
    of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year.\n\nI am asking for a donation to MDA
    to help our team bowl in this event.  \nChecks are payable to MDA.\n\nFYI, Enron
    matches all donations $20 or more. \n\nThe event will take place on Saturday,
    July 29, 2000.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\nThanks! Have
    a great day!\n\nTim Ng\nx30998\n\n"

    \nSubject: OK, Jeff, you requested that we be candid about Enron...\n\n\"Management
    does things right; Leadership does the right things.\" (Peter \nDrucker)\n\nToday
    I began to wonder if I've been a fool in staunchly defending Enron's \nVisions
    & Values. \n\nAn esteemed colleague of very strong professional reputation at
    Enron was \nrecently approached by a hiring supervisor.  Totally unexpected &
    \nunsolicited, an offer was accepted; all seemed well as this Recruit got good
    \nfeedback directly from clients & Enron upper mgmt.  But after a short time,
    \nsuddenly Recruit was told that performance was unsatisfactory.  No specific
    \nbehaviors or problems were identified as cause; no opportunity given to \nmodify;
    Recruit was summarily removed to another floor with instructions to \nfind another
    job.  Upon displacement she told me (~6 weeks ago), \"I want \navoid trouble for
    anyone; I just want to continue quietly at Enron and forget \nthis.\"  \n\nTo
    date I have honored her request for silence, but all this hullabaloo about \nEnron
    being the best place to work makes her dilemma particularly upsetting, \nand there
    is ample evidence that her plight is not unique.  I refer here to \nCindy Adams,
    formerly of Joe Sutton's office.  I don't care why it was \ndecided not to use
    HR's counseling/review process designed to help when \nthings go awry; I just
    know that Enron's best bet is to give this talented \nprofessional more time.
    \ She writes:\n\n...Last week, my HR Rep informed me that I have a deadline of
    July 15th in \nwhich to find a job...I have no assistance from HR or Recruiting.
    \ I had 2 \ninterviews 5 weeks ago and I had to initiate those myself.  I've not
    received \nanswers from postings I've responded to - I am left hanging without
    \nacknowledgment of any sort.\n\nI have been approached and learned from others
    that the same thing happened \nto them with the same circumstances; one said that
    it took her a full 3 \nmonths to land her present job.  I am not afforded that
    opportunity now ...\n\nJeff, would you please ask someone to remove Cindy's July
    15 deadline?  There \nare no rules left to break here; Cindy is trying to proceed
    diligently & \ndiscreetly, but she is under duress by not having any feedback/support
    from \nHR.   With a little boost, it's not too late to bring this picture into
    line \nwith Enron's vision of retaining topnotch people.  \n\nCindy has no idea
    that I'm writing on her behalf, and after this I intend to \nhonor her wishes
    with silence.  But you must see the irony here, not to \nmention the double standard
    in how Enron's Visions & Values are applied to \nassistants all over Enron:  Cindy
    Adams was sought after, then abruptly put \nout of the office of Joe Sutton, who
    happens to be our V&V expert!  I'm not \nblaming Joe for anything; he is simply
    the backdrop in this example.  I \nremember Joe once used an expression at a floor
    meeting:  \"believing your own \nbaloney.\"  He wasn't talking about Visions &
    Values then, but \"believing \nbaloney\" suddenly seems to fit for assistants
    who work at Enron.  You asked \nfor candid; herein I have done my very best to
    give it to you.\n\nJeff, thanks for asking and listening.  I and my colleagues
    are listening \ntoo, but seeing is believing.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nBetty
    Alexander\nSr. Administrative Assistant \n"

    Dear Mr. Lay,

    As you are no doubt aware your colleague Jeffrey Skilling  recently made a=
    =20
    keynote address at our flagship event RISK 2000 in Boston.  Building on the=
    =20
    success of that event, I would like to invite you to make the  keynote=20
    address at Energy & Power Risk Management  Conferences=01, third annual=20
    information technology event as  outlined above. This year's keynote sessio=
    n=20
    is entitled "The E-Commerce Revolution: Innovations and  opportunity in the=
    =20
    electronic energy marketplace". This session has no  bullet points as I wou=
    ld=20
    like the speaker to address only the latest issues as  they see fit. My=20
    research has showed that the industry is very interested in  your opinions =
    on=20
    this subject and I hope you can fit this hour-long session into  you busy=
    =20
    schedule.

    =01+Information Technology=01, will take a focused look  at the latest adva=
    nces=20
    being made in the energy market=01,s systems and  technologies. The confere=
    nce=20
    will be structured in two streams, offering  delegates and speakers the=20
    chance to tailor the event to their own areas of  interest. The streams wil=
    l=20
    be partitioned into five areas:=20

    1) Information technology for risk management

    2) Information technology for pricing and trading

    3) Data techniques and strategies

    4) Advanced technologies for trading and risk management

    5) Challenges of the evolving energy marketplace

    Each of these categories will investigate the kind of problems  being faced=
    =20
    by energy IT/IS managers, traders and risk managers alike. I have  attached=
     a=20
    copy of the program for your information. There will also be a  software=20
    exhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating  their=
    =20
    products, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management.

    This conference will be of the highly technical level that  people have com=
    e=20
    to expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage  participation=
    =20
    from speakers in modifying the program to suit the audience and  issues at=
    =20
    hand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please  let=
    =20
    me know; any help would be gratefully received.

    This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy  & Power Risk=20
    Management Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to  attract th=
    e=20
    leading market players by providing a first-class program with  top-rated=
    =20
    speakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy  industry.

    Unfortunately my schedule for this program is very tight. I  would greatly=
    =20
    appreciate an email soon to let me know if you would like to take  part in=
    =20
    this event. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to  ge=
    t=20
    in touch.

    I look forward to hearing from you soon.

    Yours sincerely,

    Joel Hanley

    assets and employees to American Electric Power to thank each of you for your
    teamwork and success in our years together.\n\nSome of you were here when I joined
    your company in 1984, but many of you arrived during the Enron era and might not
    know the full story of my arrival.  I was president of Transco Energy at the time
    and was probably in line to be the chairman.  I did not expect to ever join another
    energy company.  Yet the directors of Houston Natural Gas felt like a new management
    team was needed for their company to prosper in a rapidly changing industry environment.
    \ The quality of people I saw at HNG convinced me that the company would be a
    good platform from which to make major changes.  And the results over the last
    17 years could not have been better.\n\nHouston Pipeline Company has been a major
    contributor to developing Enron into what it is today.  Your professionalism,
    ideas, dedication and commitment toward this company have been instrumental in
    making our success possible.  For this, you will not only be a critical part of
    Enron's history, but you will also always deserve Enron's gratitude.\n\nI wish
    you nothing but the very best in your next endeavors, even as I am sure you will
    not need my good luck wishes.  As always, your professionalism and dedication
    will be your best allies when facing new challenges and opportunities.\n\nSincerely,\n\n

    Program\tDate:\tAugust 22, 2001\t\n\nAs most of you know, Jeff Skilling created
    the Associate/Analyst Program in 1990.  This Program is one of his most successful
    and important contributions to Enron, and will continue as a cornerstone of the
    Company.  It remains our single most important source of new talent.\n\nThe purpose
    of this memo is to reassure you that the direction, philosophy, and importance
    of the Program remains unchanged.  As we have said many times, most of our new
    businesses were created by graduates and members of the Program.  Many of the
    current leaders of our company are also graduates of the Program.\n\nThree broad
    principles will continue to guide the direction of the Program.\n?\tWe will have
    only one Associate/Analyst Program at Enron, and it is a Company asset.\n?\tWe
    will have a \"One Enron\" presence on campus to provide clarity of message and
    purpose.\n?\tThe Program is rotational in nature, and will prepare our future
    leaders for success by providing exposure to Enron's network of people and systems.\n\nThe
    business prospects for Enron, and the opportunities for personal growth and development
    have never been better.  We also enjoy the deepest and broadest talent pool we
    have ever had.  Each and every one of you can be a key contributor to making Enron

    Rick:

    As I am sure you have read by now, Jeff Skilling has chosen to leave Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.

    I want to assure you that Jeff's departure will in no way affect the relationship that Enron has with Microsoft and more specifically MSN.  I have been briefed on the MSNIA project, by my team,  and they assure me that we are on track to meet your Broadband Internet Access roll-out plans in early October.  I look forward to getting more personally involved with Microsoft to help insure that our ongoing relationship and partnership continues to mature and flourish.

    I will contact you in the near future to discuss with you this transition.  In the meantime,  if you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact my office.

    Media Reports\n\nSir,\nI read your note with great deal of interest and care.
    \ I was pleasantly surprised to see that this email was devoid of any stereotypical
    remarks that are so prevalent in the mass media today.\n\nUnfortunately, such
    is not the case with other communications being sent out on behalf of Enron Corp.
    \ A case in point is the corporate security email, titled 'Travel Security Update',
    that was send out yesterday.  In this email, reaction to possible U.S. military
    retaliation has been tied to extremist Islamic violence.  Truth of the matter
    is that any reaction to the U.S. military action could be because of extreme nationalism,
    most likely to the be the case, or even extreme regionalism.  References to Islam,
    extremism, and violence, in the manner used in the security communication only
    perpetuates the stereotypes.\n\nI would like for you and my co-workers at Enron
    to know that MUSLIMS DO NOT HATE AMERICANS (regardless of what Frank Graham wants
    to believe).  Muslims do have deep-rooted disagreements and distrusts of the American
    foreign policy but that in no way translates to what the mass media  would have
    us believe.\n\nthanks\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tEnron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON

    is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates
    of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept.
    11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals
    being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to
    withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.
    \ Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot
    provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed,
    to the greatest extent possible. \n\nPlease keep in mind that thousands of people
    who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being
    questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to
    believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please
    call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external

    that Cindy Olson talked with you about the harassment prevention training scheduled
    over the next few weeks.  In past classes, a senior-level business person has
    emphasized that harassment is not tolerated and is not consistent with Enron's
    values.   \n\nFor this set of training classes, the team asked if you could deliver
    that message via videotape.  Cindy told me that your answer is \"yes.\" \n\nI
    understand that you are scheduled to record an unrelated video on Thursday morning,
    and that it might be possible to tape this message at the end of that session.
    \ Would that work with your schedule?  If so, I will provide you with talking

    \                  This letter is to ask to please check into the\n\nirregularities
    that are going on in your company Pro-Caribe in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn this company
    there seems to be preference for two employees which are the\n\nfavorites between
    managment, mr. Roberto Aponte and mr. Rafael Medina.  The\n\ntwo employees do
    not work rotating shifts they have a steady day job make\n\nmore money than the
    other employees overtime is always given to them a one\n\nour break while  the
    other employees have to sit back and are not able to do\n\nanything about it because
    if they do they will be put on suspension and their\n\ncompany motto is ,\" If
    you dont like it quit\".  All the recognitions and cash\n\nprices go to these
    two individuals they always come out employee of the year\n\nor the trimestrial
    plant operator and then again there not plant operators.\n\nThere is no opportunity
    for other employees to advance at this site because\n\nof the discrimination and
    abuses  going on towards them and which is clearly\n\nevident.   Actually these
    two individuals hold the post that when there is an\n\nincoming ship they have
    to attend to it but lately this ship is not coming in\n\nas ofthen as it used
    to and yet this individualsstill earn the extra money\n\nwithout lifting a finger.
    \  Some of the priviliges they have is that they do\n\nnot have to work rotating
    shifts and   they are off on holidays  meanwhile\n\nthe other employees have to
    work the rotating shifts, work holidays and make\n\nless money.  Please mr. Loy
    it is in your hands to make justice for the other\n\nemployees who work hard and
    yet they dont seem to be appreciated.  All\n\npromotions and recognitions are
    based on the fact that the two employees have\n\nbought their way to their current
    positions by bringing in gifts and taking\n\ntheir employers out to dinner.  This
    action which i believe is wrong because\n\nit is just like taking a bribe.   Once
    again mr. Loy i ask for your help and\n\nhope you will be able to investigate
    and be able to straighten out this\n\nsituation.  I have witness these events
    and i do not like any type of\n\ndiscrimination i leave it in your hands."

    to hear from former employees.  Thank you also for calling attention to instances
    which, on the surface, do not appear to be representative of our expectations
    of Enron leadership.\n\nPart of our continuous improvement involves an on-going
    review of our management and the diversity of styles therein.  True, not everyone
    is agreeable to Enron's culture or the many different management styles at Enron.
    \ We do, however, expect all of our employees - not just management - to adhere

    the I am not writing this in malice but in hopes that it helps get\nEnron back
    the way it used to treat their employees and makes it the number\none employer
    of choice again.  I hope you can get back the feeling that I\nhad when I first
    started there and get the stress level down in your\norganization for the sake
    of your employees.\n\nI am a former employee who worked at Enron for 10 years
    - my husband was,\nat one time, in charge of A/P.  My one big disappointment was
    that I never\ngot to meet you.    During that time, I made a lot of friends who
    I\ncontinue to see from time to time.  I left last year and have missed the\ncompany
    since I left but would not contemplate coming back unless several\npeople have
    been replaced.  (Joannie Williamson and Sheri Sera know my\nstory.)\n\nI \"knew\"
    Jeff but I don't think he knew me by name, only by sight, even\nthough I worked
    in ENA when it only had 400 employees with 3 of us in HR.\nHe was NOT what I would
    call a people person!  Unless you were in an upper\nlevel position, he did not
    take the time to find out your name.  (Ron Burns\nis still one of my favorite
    people because of his talent with people - we\nneed more like him in the business
    world!)\n\nAs you can see, I am now working for a competitor and since I work
    in HR, I\ncontinually run into former Enron workers who have also left - most
    of\ntheir reasons are the same.\n\nIt is not that they have lost faith in Enron
    as a company but because of\nthey way they were treated by their managers.  During
    the last 5 years I\nwas there, I noticed a change in direction in the way employees
    were\ntreated by upper management - and upper management was getting away with\nit.
    \ Not only were they getting away with it, these people were being\nrewarded for
    this behavior.  I have heard stories of lower level employees\nbeing screamed
    at and in one instance, one of the VP's who was brought down\nfrom Canada was
    heard in his office screaming and pounding his telephone on\nhis desk.  Heaven
    only knows how he treats his subordinates.  Believe me,\nthe way employees are
    treated at Enron is being talked about on the streets\nof Houston and on the different
    college campuses.  You might also at some\npoint take the time to find out why
    so many good people have left the HR\ncommunity at Enron and it is not because
    they wanted to.\n\nI don't know if you will see this, but I hope so.  Good luck
    on bringing\nEnron back to way it was - I still own stock!!\n\nThanks for listening...\n\nPam
